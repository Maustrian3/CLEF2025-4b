The objective of the systematic review was to investigate the rate of ICU admission, mortality, morbidity, and complications among patients with coronavirus. METHODS: A comprehensive strategy was conducted in PubMed/Medline; Science direct and LILACS from December 2002 to May 2020 without language restriction. The Heterogeneity among the included studies was checked with forest plot, χ2 test, I2 test, and the p-values. All observational studies reporting rate of ICU admission, the prevalence of mortality and its determinants among ICU admitted patients with coronavirus were included and the rest were excluded RESULT: A total of 646 articles were identified from different databases and 50 articles were selected for evaluation. Thirty-seven Articles with 24983 participants were included. The rate of ICU admission was 32% (95% CI: 26 to 38, 37 studies and 32, 741 participants). The Meta-Analysis revealed that the pooled prevalence of mortality in patients with coronavirus disease in ICU was 39% (95% CI: 34 to 43, 37 studies and 24, 983 participants). CONCLUSION: The Meta-Analysis revealed that approximately one-third of patients admitted to ICU with severe Coronavirus disease and more than thirty percent of patients admitted to ICU with a severe form of COVID-19 for better care died which warns the health care stakeholders to give attention to intensive care patients.

D.; Malinovschi, A.; Mao, W.; Mazankova, L.; McCulloch, D.; Menges, D [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Importance: While much of the attention on the COVID-19 pandemic was directed at the daily counts of cases and those with serious disease overwhelming health services, increasingly, reports have appeared of people who experience debilitating symptoms after the initial infection. This is popularly known as long COVID. Objective: To estimate by country and territory of the number of patients affected by long COVID in 2020 and 2021, the severity of their symptoms and expected pattern of recovery Design: We jointly analyzed ten ongoing cohort studies in ten countries for the occurrence of three major symptom clusters of long COVID among representative COVID cases. The defining symptoms of the three clusters (fatigue, cognitive problems, and shortness of breath) are explicitly mentioned in the WHO clinical case definition. For incidence of long COVID, we adopted the minimum duration after infection of three months from the WHO case definition. We pooled data from the contributing studies, two large medical record databases in the United States, and findings from 44 published studies using a Bayesian meta-regression tool. We separately estimated occurrence and pattern of recovery in patients with milder acute infections and those hospitalized. We estimated the incidence and prevalence of long COVID globally and by country in 2020 and 2021 as well as the severity-weighted prevalence using disability weights from the Global Burden of Disease study. Results: Analyses are based on detailed information for 1906 community infections and 10526 hospitalized patients from the ten collaborating cohorts, three of which included children. We added published data on 37262 community infections and 9540 hospitalized patients as well as ICD-coded medical record data concerning 1.3 million infections. Globally, in 2020 and 2021, 144.7 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 54.8-312.9) people suffered from any of the three symptom clusters of long COVID. This corresponds to 3.69% (1.38-7.96) of all infections. The fatigue, respiratory, and cognitive clusters occurred in 51.0% (16.9-92.4), 60.4% (18.9-89.1), and 35.4% (9.4-75.1) of long COVID cases, respectively. Those with milder acute COVID-19 cases had a quicker estimated recovery (median duration 3.99 months [IQR 3.84-4.20]) than those admitted for the acute infection (median duration 8.84 months [IQR 8.10-9.78]). At twelve months, 15.1% (10.3-21.1) continued to experience long COVID symptoms. Conclusions and relevance: The occurrence of debilitating ongoing symptoms of COVID-19 is common. Knowing how many people are affected, and for how long, is important to plan for rehabilitative services and support to return to social activities, places of learning, and the workplace when symptoms start to wane.'}\n"

To investigate the potential route of 2019-nCov infection on the mucosa of oral cavity, bulk RNA-seq profiles from two public databases including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Functional Annotation of The Mammalian Genome Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (FANTOM5 CAGE) dataset were collected. RNA-seq profiling data of 13 organ types with para-carcinoma normal tissues from TCGA and 14 organ types with normal tissues from FANTOM5 CAGE were analyzed in order to explore and validate the expression of ACE2 on the mucosa of oral cavity. Further, single-cell transcriptomes from an independent data generated in-house were used to identify and confirm the ACE2-expressing cell composition and proportion in oral cavity. The results demonstrated that the ACE2 expressed on the mucosa of oral cavity. Interestingly, this receptor was highly enriched in epithelial cells of tongue. Preliminarily, those findings have explained the basic mechanism that the oral cavity is a potentially high risk for 2019-nCoV infectious susceptibility and provided a piece of evidence for the future prevention strategy in dental clinical practice as well as daily life.\n"

[AUTHORS]: Crook, Harry; Raza, Sanara; Nowell, Joseph; Young, Megan; Edison, Paul [JOURNAL]: BMJ [ABSTRACT]: Since its emergence in Wuhan, China, covid-19 has spread and had a profound effect on the lives and health of people around the globe. As of 4 July 2021, more than 183 million confirmed cases of covid-19 had been recorded worldwide, and 3.97 million deaths. Recent evidence has shown that a range of persistent symptoms can remain long after the acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, and this condition is now coined long covid by recognized research institutes. Studies have shown that long covid can affect the whole spectrum of people with covid-19, from those with very mild acute disease to the most severe forms. Like acute covid-19, long covid can involve multiple organs and can affect many systems including, but not limited to, the respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, gastrointestinal, and musculoskeletal systems. The symptoms of long covid include fatigue, dyspnea, cardiac abnormalities, cognitive impairment, sleep disturbances, symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, muscle pain, concentration problems, and headache. This review summarizes studies of the long term effects of covid-19 in hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients and describes the persistent symptoms they endure. Risk factors for acute covid-19 and long covid and possible therapeutic options are also discussed.', '[TITLE]: Clinical characteristics with inflammation profiling of long COVID and association with 1-year recovery following hospitalisation in the UK: a prospective observational study [AUTHORS]:  [JOURNAL]: Lancet Respir Med [ABSTRACT]: BACKGROUND: No effective pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions exist for patients with long COVID. We aimed to describe recovery 1 year after hospital discharge for COVID-19, identify factors associated with patient-perceived recovery, and identify potential therapeutic targets by describing the underlying inflammatory profiles of the previously described recovery clusters at 5 months after hospital discharge. METHODS: The Post-hospitalisation COVID-19 study (PHOSP-COVID) is a prospective, longitudinal cohort study recruiting adults (aged ≥18 years) discharged from hospital with COVID-19 across the UK. Recovery was assessed using patient-reported outcome measures, physical performance, and organ function at 5 months and 1 year after hospital discharge, and stratified by both patient-perceived recovery and recovery cluster. Hierarchical logistic regression modelling was performed for patient-perceived recovery at 1 year. Cluster analysis was done using the clustering large applications k-medoids approach using clinical outcomes at 5 months. Inflammatory protein profiling was analysed from plasma at the 5-month visit. This study is registered on the ISRCTN Registry, ISRCTN10980107, and recruitment is ongoing. FINDINGS: 2320 participants discharged from hospital between March 7, 2020, and April 18, 2021, were assessed at 5 months after discharge and 807 (32·7%) participants completed both the 5-month and 1-year visits. 279 (35·6%) of these 807 patients were women and 505 (64·4%) were men, with a mean age of 58·7 (SD 12·5) years, and 224 (27·8%) had received invasive mechanical ventilation (WHO class 7–9). The proportion of patients reporting full recovery was unchanged between 5 months (501 [25·5%] of 1965) and 1 year (232 [28·9%] of 804). Factors associated with being less likely to report full recovery at 1 year were female sex (odds ratio 0·68 [95% CI 0·46–0·99]), obesity (0·50 [0·34–0·74]) and invasive mechanical ventilation (0·42 [0·23–0·76]). Cluster analysis (n=1636) corroborated the previously reported four clusters: very severe, severe, moderate with cognitive impairment, and mild, relating to the severity of physical health, mental health, and cognitive impairment at 5 months. We found increased inflammatory mediators of tissue damage and repair in both the very severe and the moderate with cognitive impairment clusters compared with the mild cluster, including IL-6 concentration, which was increased in both comparisons (n=626 participants). We found a substantial deficit in median EQ-5D-5L utility index from before COVID-19 (retrospective assessment; 0·88 [IQR 0·74–1·00]), at 5 months (0·74 [0·64–0·88]) to 1 year (0·75 [0·62–0·88]), with minimal improvements across all outcome measures at 1 year after discharge in the whole cohort and within each of the four clusters. INTERPRETATION: The sequelae of a hospital admission with COVID-19 were substantial 1 year after discharge across a range of health domains, with the minority in our cohort feeling fully recovered. Patient-perceived health-related quality of life was reduced at 1 year compared with before hospital admission. Systematic inflammation and obesity are potential treatable traits that warrant further investigation in clinical trials.

[JOURNAL]: Brain Behav Immun [ABSTRACT]: Importance COVID-19 is associated with clinically significant symptoms despite resolution of the acute infection (i.e., post-COVID-19 syndrome). Fatigue and cognitive impairment are amongst the most common and debilitating symptoms of post-COVID-19 syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To quantify the proportion of individuals experiencing fatigue and cognitive impairment 12 or more weeks following COVID-19 diagnosis, and to characterize the inflammatory correlates and functional consequences of post-COVID-19 syndrome. DATA SOURCES: Systematic searches were conducted without language restrictions from database inception to June 8, 2021 on PubMed/MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, PsycInfo, Embase, Web of Science, Google/Google Scholar, and select reference lists. STUDY SELECTION: Primary research articles which evaluated individuals at least 12 weeks after confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis and specifically reported on fatigue, cognitive impairment, inflammatory parameters, and/or functional outcomes were selected. DATA EXTRACTION & SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers independently extracted published summary data and assessed methodological quality and risk of bias. A meta-analysis of proportions was conducted to pool Freeman-Turkey double arcsine transformed proportions using the random-effects restricted maximum-likelihood model. MAIN OUTCOMES & MEASURES: The co-primary outcomes were the proportions of individuals reporting fatigue and cognitive impairment, respectively, 12 or more weeks after COVID-19 infection. The secondary outcomes were inflammatory correlates and functional consequences of post-COVID-19 syndrome. RESULTS: The literature search yielded 10,979 studies, and 81 studies were selected for inclusion. The fatigue meta-analysis comprised 68 studies, the cognitive impairment meta-analysis comprised 43 studies, and 48 studies were included in the narrative synthesis. Meta-analysis revealed that the proportion of individuals experiencing fatigue 12 or more weeks following COVID-19 diagnosis was 0.32 (95% CI, 0.27, 0.37; p < 0.001; n = 25,268; I(2)=99.1%). The proportion of individuals exhibiting cognitive impairment was 0.22 (95% CI, 0.17, 0.28; p < 0.001; n = 13,232; I(2)=98.0). Moreover, narrative synthesis revealed elevations in proinflammatory markers and considerable functional impairment in a subset of individuals. CONCLUSIONS & RELEVANCE: A significant proportion of individuals experience persistent fatigue and/or cognitive impairment following resolution of acute COVID-19. The frequency and debilitating nature of the foregoing symptoms provides the impetus to characterize the underlying neurobiological substrates and how to best treat these phenomena.

D.; Malinovschi, A.; Mao, W.; Mazankova, L.; McCulloch, D.; Menges, D [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Importance: While much of the attention on the COVID-19 pandemic was directed at the daily counts of cases and those with serious disease overwhelming health services, increasingly, reports have appeared of people who experience debilitating symptoms after the initial infection. This is popularly known as long COVID. Objective: To estimate by country and territory of the number of patients affected by long COVID in 2020 and 2021, the severity of their symptoms and expected pattern of recovery Design: We jointly analyzed ten ongoing cohort studies in ten countries for the occurrence of three major symptom clusters of long COVID among representative COVID cases. The defining symptoms of the three clusters (fatigue, cognitive problems, and shortness of breath) are explicitly mentioned in the WHO clinical case definition. For incidence of long COVID, we adopted the minimum duration after infection of three months from the WHO case definition. We pooled data from the contributing studies, two large medical record databases in the United States, and findings from 44 published studies using a Bayesian meta-regression tool. We separately estimated occurrence and pattern of recovery in patients with milder acute infections and those hospitalized. We estimated the incidence and prevalence of long COVID globally and by country in 2020 and 2021 as well as the severity-weighted prevalence using disability weights from the Global Burden of Disease study. Results: Analyses are based on detailed information for 1906 community infections and 10526 hospitalized patients from the ten collaborating cohorts, three of which included children. We added published data on 37262 community infections and 9540 hospitalized patients as well as ICD-coded medical record data concerning 1.3 million infections. Globally, in 2020 and 2021, 144.7 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 54.8-312.9) people suffered from any of the three symptom clusters of long COVID. This corresponds to 3.69% (1.38-7.96) of all infections. The fatigue, respiratory, and cognitive clusters occurred in 51.0% (16.9-92.4), 60.4% (18.9-89.1), and 35.4% (9.4-75.1) of long COVID cases, respectively. Those with milder acute COVID-19 cases had a quicker estimated recovery (median duration 3.99 months [IQR 3.84-4.20]) than those admitted for the acute infection (median duration 8.84 months [IQR 8.10-9.78]). At twelve months, 15.1% (10.3-21.1) continued to experience long COVID symptoms. Conclusions and relevance: The occurrence of debilitating ongoing symptoms of COVID-19 is common. Knowing how many people are affected, and for how long, is important to plan for rehabilitative services and support to return to social activities, places of learning, and the workplace when symptoms start to wane.', '[TITLE]: Does pre-infection stress increase the risk of long COVID? Longitudinal associations between adversity worries and experiences in the month prior to COVID-19 infection and the development of long COVID and specific long COVID symptoms [AUTHORS]: Paul, E.; Fancourt, D. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Background Long COVID is increasingly recognised as public health burden. Demographic and infection-related characteristics have been identified as risk factors, but less research has focused on psychosocial predictors such as stress immediately preceding the index infection. Research on whether stressors predict the development of specific long COVID symptoms is also lacking. Methods Data from 1,966 UK adults who had previously been infected with COVID-19 and who took part in the UCL COVID-19 Social Study were analysed. The number of adversity experiences (e.g., job loss) and the number of worries about adversity experiences within the month prior to COVID-19 infection were used to predict the development of self-reported long COVID and the presence of three specific long COVID symptoms (difficulty with mobility, cognition, and self-care). The interaction between a three-level index of socio-economic position (SEP; with higher values indicating lower SEP) and the exposure variables in relation to long COVID status was also examined. Analyses controlled for a range of COVID-19 infection characteristics, socio-demographics, and health-related factors. Findings Odds of self-reported long COVID increased by 1.25 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04 to 1.51) for each additional worry about adversity in the month prior to COVID-19 infection. Although there was no evidence for an interaction between SEP and either exposure variable, individuals in the lowest SEP group were nearly twice as likely to have developed long COVID as those in the highest SEP group (OR: 1.95; 95% CI: 1.19 to 3.19) and worries about adversity experiences remained a predictor of long COVID (OR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.98). The number of worries about adversity experiences also corresponded with increased odds of certain long COVID symptoms such as difficulty with cognition (e.g., difficulty remembering or concentrating) by 1.46 (95% CI: 1.02 to 2.09) but not with mobility (e.g., walking or climbing steps) or self-care (e.g., washing all over or dressing). Interpretation Results suggest a key role of stress in the time preceding the acute COVID-19 infection for the development of long COVID and for difficulty with cognition specifically. These findings point to the importance of mitigating worries and experiences of adversities during pandemics both to reduce their psychological impact but also help reduce the societal burden of longer-term illness.', \"[TITLE]: Characterizing long COVID in an international cohort: 7 months of symptoms and their impact [AUTHORS]: Davis, Hannah E.; Assaf, Gina S.; McCorkell, Lisa; Wei, Hannah; Low, Ryan J.; Re'em, Yochai; Redfield, Signe; Austin, Jared P.; Akrami, Athena [JOURNAL]: EClinicalMedicine [ABSTRACT]: BACKGROUND: A significant number of patients with COVID-19 experience prolonged symptoms, known as Long COVID. Few systematic studies have investigated this population, particularly in outpatient settings. Hence, relatively little is known about symptom makeup and severity, expected clinical course, impact on daily functioning, and return to baseline health. METHODS: We conducted an online survey of people with suspected and confirmed COVID-19, distributed via COVID-19 support groups (e.g. Body Politic, Long COVID Support Group, Long Haul COVID Fighters) and social media (e.g. Twitter, Facebook). Data were collected from September 6, 2020 to November 25, 2020. We analyzed responses from 3762 participants with confirmed (diagnostic/antibody positive; 1020) or suspected (diagnostic/antibody negative or untested; 2742) COVID-19, from 56 countries, with illness lasting over 28 days and onset prior to June 2020. We estimated the prevalence of 203 symptoms in 10 organ systems and traced 66 symptoms over seven months. We measured the impact on life, work, and return to baseline health. FINDINGS: For the majority of respondents (>91%), the time to recovery exceeded 35 weeks. During their illness, participants experienced an average of 55.9+/- 25.5 (mean+/-STD) symptoms, across an average of 9.1 organ systems. The most frequent symptoms after month 6 were fatigue, post-exertional malaise, and cognitive dysfunction. Symptoms varied in their prevalence over time, and we identified three symptom clusters, each with a characteristic temporal profile. 85.9% of participants (95% CI, 84.8% to 87.0%) experienced relapses, primarily triggered by exercise, physical or mental activity, and stress. 86.7% (85.6% to 92.5%) of unrecovered respondents were experiencing fatigue at the time of survey, compared to 44.7% (38.5% to 50.5%) of recovered respondents. 1700 respondents (45.2%) required a reduced work schedule compared to pre-illness, and an additional 839 (22.3%) were not working at the time of survey due to illness. Cognitive dysfunction or memory issues were common across all age groups (~88%). Except for loss of smell and taste, the prevalence and trajectory of all symptoms were similar between groups with confirmed and suspected COVID-19. INTERPRETATION: Patients with Long COVID report prolonged, multisystem involvement and significant disability. By seven months, many patients have not yet recovered (mainly from systemic and neurological/cognitive symptoms), have not returned to previous levels of work, and continue to experience significant symptom burden.

However, there is little information regarding the nature and broader prevalence of cognitive problems post-infection or across the full spread of disease severity. METHODS: We sought to confirm whether there was an association between cross-sectional cognitive performance data from 81,337 participants who between January and December 2020 undertook a clinically validated web-optimized assessment as part of the Great British Intelligence Test, and questionnaire items capturing self-report of suspected and confirmed COVID-19 infection and respiratory symptoms. FINDINGS: People who had recovered from COVID-19, including those no longer reporting symptoms, exhibited significant cognitive deficits versus controls when controlling for age, gender, education level, income, racial-ethnic group, pre-existing medical disorders, tiredness, depression and anxiety. The deficits were of substantial effect size for people who had been hospitalised (N = 192), but also for non-hospitalised cases who had biological confirmation of COVID-19 infection (N = 326). Analysing markers of premorbid intelligence did not support these differences being present prior to infection. Finer grained analysis of performance across sub-tests supported the hypothesis that COVID-19 has a multi-domain impact on human cognition. INTERPRETATION: Interpretation. These results accord with reports of ‘Long Covid’ cognitive symptoms that persist into the early-chronic phase. They should act as a clarion call for further research with longitudinal and neuroimaging cohorts to plot recovery trajectories and identify the biological basis of cognitive deficits in SARS-COV-2 survivors.

[JOURNAL]: Front Aging Neurosci [ABSTRACT]: COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been often characterized as a respiratory disease. However, it is increasingly being understood as an infection that impacts multiple systems, and many patients report neurological symptoms. Indeed, there is accumulating evidence for neural damage in some individuals, with recent studies suggesting loss of gray matter in multiple regions, particularly in the left hemisphere. There are several mechanisms by which the COVID-19 infection may lead to neurological symptoms and structural and functional changes in the brain, and cognitive problems are one of the most commonly reported symptoms in those experiencing Long COVID – the chronic illness following the COVID-19 infection that affects between 10 and 25% of patients. However, there is yet little research testing cognition in Long COVID. The COVID and Cognition Study is a cross-sectional/longitudinal study aiming to understand cognitive problems in Long COVID. The first paper from the study explored the characteristics of our sample of 181 individuals who had experienced the COVID-19 infection, and 185 who had not, and the factors that predicted ongoing symptoms and self-reported cognitive deficits. In this second paper from the study, we assess this sample on tests of memory, language, and executive function. We hypothesize that performance on “objective” cognitive tests will reflect self-reported cognitive symptoms. We further hypothesize that some symptom profiles may be more predictive of cognitive performance than others, perhaps giving some information about the mechanism. We found a consistent pattern of memory deficits in those that had experienced the COVID-19 infection, with deficits increasing with the severity of self-reported ongoing symptoms. Fatigue/Mixed symptoms during the initial illness and ongoing neurological symptoms were predictive of cognitive performance.', '[TITLE]: Health outcomes in people 2 years after surviving hospitalisation with COVID-19: a longitudinal cohort study [AUTHORS]: Huang, Lixue; Li, Xia; Gu, Xiaoying; Zhang, Hui; Ren, LiLi; Guo, Li; Liu, Min; Wang, Yimin; Cui, Dan; Wang, Yeming; Zhang, Xueyang; Shang, Lianhan; Zhong, Jingchuan; Wang, Xinming; Wang, Jianwei; Cao, Bin [JOURNAL]: Lancet Respir Med [ABSTRACT]: BACKGROUND: With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, growing evidence shows that a considerable proportion of people who have recovered from COVID-19 have long-term effects on multiple organs and systems. A few longitudinal studies have reported on the persistent health effects of COVID-19, but the follow-up was limited to 1 year after acute infection. The aim of our study was to characterise the longitudinal evolution of health outcomes in hospital survivors with different initial disease severity throughout 2 years after acute COVID-19 infection and to determine their recovery status. METHODS: We did an ambidirectional, longitudinal cohort study of individuals who had survived hospitalisation with COVID-19 and who had been discharged from Jin Yin-tan Hospital (Wuhan, China) between Jan 7 and May 29, 2020. We measured health outcomes 6 months (June 16–Sept 3, 2020), 12 months (Dec 16, 2020–Feb 7, 2021), and 2 years (Nov 16, 2021–Jan 10, 2022) after symptom onset with a 6-min walking distance (6MWD) test, laboratory tests, and a series of questionnaires on symptoms, mental health, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), return to work, and health-care use after discharge. A subset of COVID-19 survivors received pulmonary function tests and chest imaging at each visit. Age-matched, sex-matched, and comorbidities-matched participants without COVID-19 infection (controls) were introduced to determine the recovery status of COVID-19 survivors at 2 years. The primary outcomes included symptoms, modified British Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnoea scale, HRQoL, 6MWD, and return to work, and were assessed in all COVID-19 survivors who attended all three follow-up visits. Symptoms, mMRC dyspnoea scale, and HRQoL were also assessed in controls. FINDINGS: 2469 patients with COVID-19 were discharged from Jin Yin-tan Hospital between Jan 7 and May 29, 2020. 1192 COVID-19 survivors completed assessments at the three follow-up visits and were included in the final analysis, 1119 (94%) of whom attended the face-to-face interview 2 years after infection. The median age at discharge was 57·0 years (48·0–65·0) and 551 (46%) were women. The median follow-up time after symptom onset was 185·0 days (IQR 175·0–197·0) for the visit at 6 months, 349·0 days (337·0–360·0) for the visit at 12 months, and 685·0 days (675·0–698·0) for the visit at 2 years. The proportion of COVID-19 survivors with at least one sequelae symptom decreased significantly from 777 (68%) of 1149 at 6 months to 650 (55%) of 1190 at 2 years (p<0·0001), with fatigue or muscle weakness always being the most frequent. The proportion of COVID-19 survivors with an mMRC score of at least 1 was 168 (14%) of 1191 at 2 years, significantly lower than the 288 (26%) of 1104 at 6 months (p<0·0001). HRQoL continued to improve in almost all domains, especially in terms of anxiety or depression: the proportion of individuals with symptoms of anxiety or depression decreased from 256 (23%) of 1105 at 6 months to 143 (12%) 1191 at 2 years (p<0·0001). The proportion of individuals with a 6MWD less than the lower limit of the normal range declined continuously in COVID-19 survivors overall and in the three subgroups of varying initial disease severity. 438 (89%) of 494 COVID-19 survivors had returned to their original work at 2 years. Survivors with long COVID symptoms at 2 years had lower HRQoL, worse exercise capacity, more mental health abnormality, and increased health-care use after discharge than survivors without long COVID symptoms. COVID-19 survivors still had more prevalent symptoms and more problems in pain or discomfort, as well as anxiety or depression, at 2 years than did controls. Additionally, a significantly higher proportion of survivors who had received higher-level respiratory support during hospitalisation had lung diffusion impairment (43 [65%] of 66 vs 24 [36%] of 66, p=0·0009), reduced residual volume (41 [62%] vs 13 [20%], p<0·0001), and total lung capacity (26 [39%] vs four [6%], p<0·0001) than did controls. INTERPRETATION: Regardless of initial disease severity, COVID-19 survivors had longitudinal improvements in physical and mental health, with most returning to their original work within 2 years; however, the burden of symptomatic sequelae remained fairly high. COVID-19 survivors had a remarkably lower health status than the general population at 2 years. The study findings indicate that there is an urgent need to explore the pathogenesis of long COVID and develop effective interventions to reduce the risk of long COVID.', '[TITLE]: Cognitive decline and brainstem hypometabolism in long COVID: A case series [AUTHORS]: Hugon, Jacques; Queneau, Mathieu; Sanchez Ortiz, Marta; Msika, Eva Flore; Farid, Karim; Paquet, Claire [JOURNAL]: Brain Behav [ABSTRACT]: OBJECTIVE: To assess FDG cerebral PET in patients suffering from cognitive impairment linked to Long COVID. The COVID pandemic has affected dozens of millions of people around the world and has resulted in the deaths of more than 3 million people. Following the acute forms, it has been reported sometimes long forms of COVID, with involvements of several organs including the brain. Neurological complications can include cognitive disturbances (brain fog) that are very common and can seriously disturb the life of patients. METHODS: Fluorodeoxyglucose PETs were performed in 3 patients with cognitive decline following COVID infection. RESULTS: We report here 3 cases of brain fog with major hypometabolic areas of the pons revealed by the cerebral FDG PET. CONCLUSION: The dysfunction of the locus coeruleus in these patients could partly explain the cognitive disorders observed. Further studies involving larger cohorts of patients suffering from cognitive dysfunction will be needed to determine if the brainstem is frequently affected in these patients.', '[TITLE]: Multi-organ impairment and Long COVID: a 1-year prospective, longitudinal cohort study [AUTHORS]: Dennis, A.; Cuthbertson, D.

J.; Banerjee, R.; Banerjee, A. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Importance: Multi-organ impairment associated with Long COVID is a significant burden to individuals, populations and health systems, presenting challenges for diagnosis and care provision. Standardised assessment across multiple organs over time is lacking, particularly in non-hospitalised individuals. Objective: To determine the prevalence of organ impairment in Long COVID patients at 6 and at 12 months after initial symptoms and to explore links to clinical presentation. Design: This was a prospective, longitudinal study in individuals following recovery from acute COVID-19. We assessed symptoms, health status, and multi-organ tissue characterisation and function, using consensus definitions for single and multi-organ impairment. Physiological and biochemical investigations were performed at baseline on all individuals and those with organ impairment were reassessed, including multi-organ MRI, 6 months later. Setting: Two non-acute settings (Oxford and London). Participants: 536 individuals (mean 45 years, 73% female, 89% white, 32% healthcare workers, 13% acute COVID-19 hospitalisation) completed baseline assessment (median: 6 months post-COVID-19). 331 (62%) with organ impairment or incidental findings had follow up, with reduced symptom burden from baseline (median number of symptoms: 10 and 3, at 6 and 12 months). Exposure: SARS-CoV-2 infection 6 months prior to first assessment. Main outcome: Prevalence of single and multi-organ impairment at 6 and 12 months post-COVID-19. Results: Extreme breathlessness (36% and 30%), cognitive dysfunction (50% and 38%) and poor health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L<0.7; 55% and 45%) were common at 6 and 12 months, and associated with female gender, younger age and single organ impairment. At baseline, there was fibro-inflammation in the heart (9%), pancreas (9%), kidney (15%) and liver (11%); increased volume in liver (7%), spleen (8%) and kidney (9%); decreased capacity in lungs (2%); and excessive fat deposition in the liver (25%) and pancreas (15%). Single and multi-organ impairment were present in 59% and 23% at baseline, persisting in 59% and 27% at follow-up. Conclusion and Relevance: Organ impairment was present in 59% of individuals at 6 months post-COVID-19, persisting in 59% of those followed up at 1 year, with implications for symptoms, quality of life and longer-term health, signalling need for prevention and integrated care of Long COVID.

We conducted a self-administered questionnaire survey on sequelae, psychological distress (K6), impairments in work performance (WFun), and COVID-19–related experiences of stigma and discrimination in two designated COVID-19 hospitals in Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan, between August 2020 and March 2021. The prevalence of sequelae was calculated by age and COVID-19 severity. Factors independently associated with sequelae or psychological distress were identified using logistic regression analysis. Among 127 patients who had recovered from COVID-19, 52.0% had persistent symptoms at a median of 29 days [IQR 23–128] after COVID-19 onset. Among patients with mild COVID-19, 49.5% had sequelae. The most frequent symptoms were olfactory disorders (15.0%), taste disorders (14.2%), and cough (14.2%). Multivariate analysis showed that age was an independent risk factor for sequelae (adjusted odds ratios [AOR] for ≥ 60 years vs. < 40 years 3.63, p = 0.0165). Possible psychological distress was noted in 30.7% (17.9% of males and 45.0% of females). Female sex and the presence of sequelae were independent risk factors for psychological distress. Of all participants, 29.1% had possible impairments in work performance. Experiences of stigma and discrimination were reported by 43.3% of participants. This study revealed the significant impacts of Long COVID on health in local communities.

[AUTHORS]: Suarez-Gonzalez, A.; Rajagopalan, J.; Livingston, G.; Alladi, S. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Background: Covid-19 control policies have entailed lockdowns and confinement. Although these isolation measures are thought to be particularly hard and possibly harmful to people with dementia, their specific impact during the pandemic has not yet been synthesised. We aimed to examine and summarise the global research evidence describing the effect of Covid-19 isolation measures on the health of people living with dementia. Method: We searched Pubmed, PsycINFO and CINAHL up to February 2021 for peer-reviewed quantitative studies of the effects of isolation measures during Covid-19 on cognitive, psychological and functional symptoms of people with any kind of dementia or mild cognitive impairment. We summarised the findings of included papers following current guidelines for rapid reviews. Results: We identified 15 eligible papers, examining a total of 6,442 people with dementia. 13/15 were conducted in people living in the community and 2 in care homes. 60% (9/15) studies reported changes in cognition with 77% (7/9) of them describing declined cognition by >50% of respondents. 93% (14/15) of studies reported worsening or new onset of behavioural and psychological symptoms. 46% (7/15) studies reported changes in daily function, 6 of them reporting a functional decline in a variable proportion of the population studied. Conclusion: Lockdowns and confinement measures brought about by the pandemic have damaged the cognitive and psychological health and functional abilities of people with dementia across the world. It is urgent that infection control measures applied to people with dementia are balanced against the principles of non-maleficence. This systematic review makes 4 specific calls for action.', '[TITLE]: The impact of COVID-19 social isolation on aspects of emotional and social cognition. [AUTHORS]: Bland, Amy Rachel; Roiser, Jonathan Paul; Mehta, Mitul Ashok; Sahakian, Barbara Jacquelyn; Robbins, Trevor William; Elliott, Rebecca [JOURNAL]: Cognition & emotion [ABSTRACT]: The present study aimed to examine the impact of COVID-19 social isolation upon aspects of emotional and social cognitive function. We predicted that greater impairments in emotional and social cognition would be observed in people who experienced more disruption to their usual social connectivity during COVID-19 social isolation. Healthy volunteers (N = 92) without prior mental health problems completed assessments online in their own homes during the most stringent period of the first COVID-19 \"lockdown\" in the UK (March - May 2020). Measures included two questionnaires probing levels of social isolation, anxiety levels, as well as five neuropsychological tasks assessing emotional and social cognition. Reduced positive bias in emotion recognition was related to reduced contact with friends, household size and communication method during social isolation. In addition, reduced positive bias for attention to emotional faces was related to frequency of contact with friends during social isolation. Greater cooperative behaviour in an ultimatum game was associated with more frequent contact with both friends and family during social isolation. The present study provides important insights into the detrimental effects of subjective and objective social isolation upon affective cognitive processes.', '[TITLE]: Long COVID: The Nature of Thrombotic Sequelae Determines the Necessity of Early Anticoagulation [AUTHORS]: Wang, Chengyue; Yu, Chengyuan; Jing, Haijiao; Wu, Xiaoming; Novakovic, Valerie A.; Xie, Rujuan; Shi, Jialan [JOURNAL]: Front Cell Infect Microbiol [ABSTRACT]: Many discharged COVID-19 patients affected by sequelae experience reduced quality of life leading to an increased burden on the healthcare system, their families and society at large. Possible pathophysiological mechanisms of long COVID include: persistent viral replication, chronic hypoxia and inflammation. Ongoing vascular endothelial damage promotes platelet adhesion and coagulation, resulting in the impairment of various organ functions. Meanwhile, thrombosis will further aggravate vasculitis contributing to further deterioration. Thus, long COVID is essentially a thrombotic sequela. Unfortunately, there is currently no effective treatment for long COVID. This article summarizes the evidence for coagulation abnormalities in long COVID, with a focus on the pathophysiological mechanisms of thrombosis. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by various types of cells can carry SARS-CoV-2 through the circulation and attack distant tissues and organs. Furthermore, EVs express tissue factor and phosphatidylserine (PS) which aggravate thrombosis. Given the persistence of the virus, chronic inflammation and endothelial damage are inevitable. Pulmonary structural changes such as hypertension, embolism and fibrosis are common in long COVID. The resulting impaired lung function and chronic hypoxia again aggravates vascular inflammation and coagulation abnormalities. In this article, we also summarize recent research on antithrombotic therapy in COVID-19. There is increasing evidence that early anticoagulation can be effective in improving outcomes. In fact, persistent systemic vascular inflammation and dysfunction caused by thrombosis are key factors driving various complications of long COVID. Early prophylactic anticoagulation can prevent the release of or remove procoagulant substances, thereby protecting the vascular endothelium from damage, reducing thrombotic sequelae, and improving quality of life for long-COVID patients.', '[TITLE]: Physical, cognitive, and mental health impacts of COVID-19 after hospitalisation (PHOSP-COVID): a UK multicentre, prospective cohort study [AUTHORS]: Evans, Rachael A; McAuley, Hamish; Harrison, Ewen M; Shikotra, Aarti; Singapuri, Amisha; Sereno, Marco; Elneima, Omer; Docherty, Annemarie B; Lone, Nazir I; Leavy, Olivia C; Daines, Luke; Baillie, J Kenneth; Brown, Jeremy S; Chalder, Trudie; De Soyza, Anthony; Diar Bakerly, Nawar; Easom, Nicholas; Geddes, John R; Greening, Neil J; Hart, Nick; Heaney, Liam G; Heller, Simon; Howard, Luke; Hurst, John R; Jacob, Joseph; Jenkins, R Gisli; Jolley, Caroline; Kerr, Steven; Kon, Onn M; Lewis, Keir; Lord, Janet M; McCann, Gerry P; Neubauer, Stefan; Openshaw, Peter J M; Parekh, Dhruv; Pfeffer, Paul; Rahman, Najib M; Raman, Betty; Richardson, Matthew; Rowland, Matthew; Semple, Malcolm G; Shah, Ajay M; Singh, Sally J; Sheikh, Aziz; Thomas, David; Toshner, Mark; Chalmers, James D; Ho, Ling-Pei; Horsley, Alex; Marks, Michael; Poinasamy, Krisnah; Wain, Louise V; Brightling, Christopher E [JOURNAL]: Lancet Respir Med [ABSTRACT]: BACKGROUND: The impact of COVID-19 on physical and mental health and employment after hospitalisation with acute disease is not well understood. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of COVID-19-related hospitalisation on health and employment, to identify factors associated with recovery, and to describe recovery phenotypes. METHODS: The Post-hospitalisation COVID-19 study (PHOSP-COVID) is a multicentre, long-term follow-up study of adults (aged ≥18 years) discharged from hospital in the UK with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, involving an assessment between 2 and 7 months after discharge, including detailed recording of symptoms, and physiological and biochemical testing. Multivariable logistic regression was done for the primary outcome of patient-perceived recovery, with age, sex, ethnicity, body-mass index, comorbidities, and severity of acute illness as covariates. A post-hoc cluster analysis of outcomes for breathlessness, fatigue, mental health, cognitive impairment, and physical performance was done using the clustering large applications k-medoids approach. The study is registered on the ISRCTN Registry (ISRCTN10980107). FINDINGS: We report findings for 1077 patients discharged from hospital between March 5 and Nov 30, 2020, who underwent assessment at a median of 5·9 months (IQR 4·9–6·5) after discharge. Participants had a mean age of 58 years (SD 13); 384 (36%) were female, 710 (69%) were of white ethnicity, 288 (27%) had received mechanical ventilation, and 540 (50%) had at least two comorbidities. At follow-up, only 239 (29%) of 830 participants felt fully recovered, 158 (20%) of 806 had a new disability (assessed by the Washington Group Short Set on Functioning), and 124 (19%) of 641 experienced a health-related change in occupation. Factors associated with not recovering were female sex, middle age (40–59 years), two or more comorbidities, and more severe acute illness. The magnitude of the persistent health burden was substantial but only weakly associated with the severity of acute illness. Four clusters were identified with different severities of mental and physical health impairment (n=767): very severe (131 patients, 17%), severe (159, 21%), moderate along with cognitive impairment (127, 17%), and mild (350, 46%). Of the outcomes used in the cluster analysis, all were closely related except for cognitive impairment. Three (3%) of 113 patients in the very severe cluster, nine (7%) of 129 in the severe cluster, 36 (36%) of 99 in the moderate cluster, and 114 (43%) of 267 in the mild cluster reported feeling fully recovered. Persistently elevated serum C-reactive protein was positively associated with cluster severity. INTERPRETATION: We identified factors related to not recovering after hospital admission with COVID-19 at 6 months after discharge (eg, female sex, middle age, two or more comorbidities, and more acute severe illness), and four different recovery phenotypes. The severity of physical and mental health impairments were closely related, whereas cognitive health impairments were independent. In clinical care, a proactive approach is needed across the acute severity spectrum, with interdisciplinary working, wide access to COVID-19 holistic clinical services, and the potential to stratify care.

Patients, many with initially ‘mild’ illness, used various kinds of evidence and advocacy to demonstrate a longer, more complex course of illness than laid out in initial reports from Wuhan. Long Covid has a strong claim to be the first illness created through patients finding one another on social media: it moved from patients, through various media, to formal clinical and policy channels in just a few months. This initial mapping of Long Covid – by two patients with this illness – focuses on actors in the UK and USA and demonstrates how patients marshalled epistemic authority. Patient knowledge needs to be incorporated into how COVID-19 is conceptualised, researched, and treated.', \"[TITLE]: A further plot twist: will 'long COVID' have an impact on dentistry and the dental workforce? [AUTHORS]: Agar, Stephanie; Morgan, Elise; Lee, Yee [JOURNAL]: Br Dent J [ABSTRACT]: COVID-19 has dominated our lives since the start of the pandemic in 2020, as well as greatly impacting dentistry, its patients and the dental profession. A new and potentially further problematic phenomenon is that of long COVID, a term used to describe the effects of COVID-19 that continue for weeks, or even months, beyond the initial illness. It is characterised by debilitating symptoms including extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, insomnia, heart palpitations and prolonged high temperature. With one in ten people in the UK suffering from long COVID, there will undoubtedly be a considerable impact on dentistry provision; there will be ramifications not only for patients, but also the workforce, both physically and mentally. The aim of this article is to explore the obstacles we will face due to long COVID, examining possible challenges but also possible solutions.\", '[TITLE]: Multi-organ impairment in low-risk individuals with long COVID [AUTHORS]: Dennis, A.; Wamil, M.; Kapur, S.; Alberts, J.; Badley, A.; Decker, G. A.; Rizza, S. A.; Banerjee, R.; Banerjee, A. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has disproportionately affected older individuals and those with underlying medical conditions. Research has focused on short-term outcomes in hospital, and single organ involvement. Consequently, impact of long COVID (persistent symptoms three months post-infection) across multiple organs in low-risk individuals is yet to be assessed. Methods: An ongoing prospective, longitudinal, two-centre, observational study was performed in individuals symptomatic after recovery from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Symptoms and organ function (heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, pancreas, spleen) were assessed by standardised questionnaires (EQ-5D-5L, Dyspnoea-12), blood investigations and quantitative magnetic resonance imaging, defining single and multi-organ impairment by consensus definitions. Findings: Between April and September 2020, 201 individuals (mean age 44 (SD 11.0) years, 70% female, 87% white, 31% healthcare workers) completed assessments following SARS-CoV-2 infection (median 140, IQR 105-160 days after initial symptoms). The prevalence of pre-existing conditions (obesity: 20%, hypertension: 6%; diabetes: 2%; heart disease: 4%) was low, and only 18% of individuals had been hospitalised with COVID-19. Fatigue (98%), muscle aches (88%), breathlessness (87%), and headaches (83%) were the most frequently reported symptoms. Ongoing cardiorespiratory (92%) and gastrointestinal (73%) symptoms were common, and 42% of individuals had ten or more symptoms. There was evidence of mild organ impairment in heart (32%), lungs (33%), kidneys (12%), liver (10%), pancreas (17%), and spleen (6%). Single (66%) and multi-organ (25%) impairment was observed, and was significantly associated with risk of prior COVID-19 hospitalisation (p<0.05). Interpretation: In a young, low-risk population with ongoing symptoms, almost 70% of individuals have impairment in one or more organs four months after initial symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. There are implications not only for burden of long COVID but also public health approaches which have assumed low risk in young people with no comorbidities.', \"[TITLE]: 'Reluctant pioneer': A qualitative study of doctors' experiences as patients with long COVID [AUTHORS]: Taylor, Anna K.; Kingstone, Tom; Briggs, Tracy A.; O'Donnell, Catherine A.; Atherton, Helen; Blane, David N.; Chew‐Graham, Carolyn A. [JOURNAL]: Health Expect [ABSTRACT]: BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) pandemic has had far‐reaching effects upon lives, healthcare systems and society. Some who had an apparently 'mild' COVID‐19 infection continue to suffer from persistent symptoms, including chest pain, breathlessness, fatigue, cognitive impairment, paraesthesia, muscle and joint pains. This has been labelled 'long COVID'. This paper reports the experiences of doctors with long COVID. METHODS: A qualitative study; interviews with doctors experiencing persistent symptoms were conducted by telephone or video call. Interviews were transcribed and analysis conducted using an inductive and thematic approach. RESULTS: Thirteen doctors participated. The following themes are reported: making sense of symptoms, feeling let down, using medical knowledge and connections, wanting to help and be helped, combining patient and professional identity. Experiencing long COVID can be transformative: many expressed hope that good would come of their experiences. Distress related to feelings of being ‘let down’ and the hard work of trying to access care. Participants highlighted that they felt better able to care for, and empathize with, patients with chronic conditions, particularly where symptoms are unexplained. CONCLUSIONS: The study adds to the literature on the experiences of doctors as patients, in particular where evidence is emerging and the patient has to take the lead in finding solutions to their problems and accessing their own care. PATIENT AND PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: The study was developed with experts by experience (including co‐authors HA and TAB) who contributed to the protocol and ethics application, and commented on analysis and implications. All participants were given the opportunity to comment on findings.\", \"[TITLE]: Cerebral microvascular endothelial glycocalyx damage, its implications on the blood-brain barrier and a possible contributor to cognitive impairment [AUTHORS]: Stoddart, Patrice; Satchell, Simon C; Ramnath, Raina [JOURNAL]: Brain Res [ABSTRACT]: The socio-economic impact of diseases associated with cognitive impairment is increasing. According to the Alzheimer's Society there are over 850,000 people with dementia in the UK, costing the UK £26 billion in 2013. Therefore, research into treatment of those conditions is vital. Research into the cerebral endothelial glycocalyx (CeGC) could offer effective treatments. The CeGC, consisting of proteoglycans, glycoproteins and glycolipids, is a dynamic structure covering the luminal side oftheendothelial cells of capillaries throughout the body. The CeGC is thicker in cerebral micro vessels, suggesting specialisation for its function as part of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Recent research evidences that the CeGC is vital in protecting fragile parenchymal tissue and effective functioning of the BBB, as one particularly important CeGC function is to act as a protective barrier and permeability regulator. CeGC degradation is one of the factors which can lead to an increase in BBB permeability. It occurs naturally in aging, nevertheless, premature degradationhas beenevidencedin multipleconditions linked to cognitive impairment, such as inflammation,brain edema, cerebral malaria, Alzheimer's and recently Covid-19. Increasing knowledge of the mechanisms of CeGC damage has led to research into preventative techniques showing that CeGC is a possible diagnostic marker and a therapeutic target. However, the evidence is relatively new, inconsistent and demonstrated mainly in experimental models. This review evaluates the current knowledge of the CeGC, its structure, functions, damage and repair mechanisms and the impact of its degeneration on cognitive impairment in multiple conditions, highlighting the CeGC as a possible diagnostic marker and a potential target for therapeutic treatment.\", '[TITLE]: Health behaviours the month prior to COVID-19 infection and the development of self-reported long COVID and specific long COVID symptoms: A longitudinal analysis of 1,811 UK adults [AUTHORS]: Paul, E.; Fancourt, D. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Abstract Background Demographic and infection-related characteristics have been identified as risk factors for long COVID, but research on the influence of health behaviours (e.g., exercise, smoking) immediately preceding the index infection is lacking. Methods 1,811 UK adults from the UCL COVID-19 Social Study and who had previously been infected with COVID-19 were analysed. Health behaviours in the month before infection were weekly exercise frequency, days of fresh air per week, sleep quality, smoking, consuming more than the number of recommended alcoholic drinks per week (>14), and the number of mental health care behaviours (e.g., online mental health programme). Logistic regressions controlling for covariates (e.g., COVID-19 infection severity and pre-existing health conditions) examined the impact of health behaviours on long COVID and three long COVID symptoms (difficulty with mobility, cognition, and self-care). Results In the month before infection with COVID-19, poor quality sleep increased the odds of long COVID (odds ratio [OR]: 3.53; (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.01 to 6.21), as did average quality sleep (OR: 2.44; 95% CI: 1.44 to 4.12). Having smoked (OR: 8.39; 95% CI: 1.86 to 37.91) increased and meeting recommended weekly physical activity guidelines (3+ hours) (OR: 0.05; 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.39) reduced the likelihood of difficulty with self-care (e.g., washing all over or dressing) amongst those with long COVID. Conclusion Results point to the importance of sleep quality for long COVID, potentially helping to explain previously demonstrated links between stress and long COVID. Results also suggest that exercise and smoking may be modifiable risk factors for preventing the development of difficulty with self-care.

[AUTHORS]: Ho, Emma Kwan-Yee; Chen, Lingxiao; Simic, Milena; Ashton-James, Claire Elizabeth; Comachio, Josielli; Wang, Daniel Xin Mo; Hayden, Jill Alison; Ferreira, Manuela Loureiro; Ferreira, Paulo Henrique [JOURNAL]: BMJ [ABSTRACT]: OBJECTIVE To determine the comparative effectiveness and safety of psychological interventions for chronic low back pain. DESIGN Systematic review with network meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, SCOPUS, and CINAHL from database inception to 31 January 2021. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR STUDY SELECTION Randomised controlled trials comparing psychological interventions with any comparison intervention in adults with chronic, non-specific low back pain. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and confidence in the evidence. Primary outcomes were physical function and pain intensity. A random effects network meta-analysis using a frequentist approach was performed at post-intervention (from the end of treatment to <2 months post-intervention); and at short term (≥2 to <6 months post-intervention), mid-term (≥6 to <12 months post-intervention), and long term follow-up (≥12 months post-intervention). Physiotherapy care was the reference comparison intervention. The design-by-treatment interaction model was used to assess global inconsistency and the Bucher method was used to assess local inconsistency. RESULTS 97 randomised controlled trials involving 13 136 participants and 17 treatment nodes were included. Inconsistency was detected at short term and mid-term follow-up for physical function, and short term follow-up for pain intensity, and were resolved through sensitivity analyses. For physical function, cognitive behavioural therapy (standardised mean difference 1.01, 95% confidence interval 0.58 to 1.44), and pain education (0.62, 0.08 to 1.17), delivered with physiotherapy care, resulted in clinically important improvements at post-intervention (moderate quality evidence). The most sustainable effects of treatment for improving physical function were reported with pain education delivered with physiotherapy care, at least until mid-term follow-up (0.63, 0.25 to 1.00; low quality evidence). No studies investigated the long term effectiveness of pain education delivered with physiotherapy care. For pain intensity, behavioural therapy (1.08, 0.22 to 1.94), cognitive behavioural therapy (0.92, 0.43 to 1.42), and pain education (0.91, 0.37 to 1.45), delivered with physiotherapy care, resulted in clinically important effects at post-intervention (low to moderate quality evidence). Only behavioural therapy delivered with physiotherapy care maintained clinically important effects on reducing pain intensity until mid-term follow-up (1.01, 0.41 to 1.60; high quality evidence). CONCLUSIONS For people with chronic, non-specific low back pain, psychological interventions are most effective when delivered in conjunction with physiotherapy care (mainly structured exercise). Pain education programmes (low to moderate quality evidence) and behavioural therapy (low to high quality evidence) result in the most sustainable effects of treatment; however, uncertainty remains as to their long term effectiveness. Although inconsistency was detected, potential sources were identified and resolved. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION PROSPERO CRD42019138074.', '[TITLE]: Characteristics and impact of Long Covid: Findings from an online survey [AUTHORS]: Ziauddeen, Nida; Gurdasani, Deepti; O’Hara, Margaret E.; Hastie, Claire; Roderick, Paul; Yao, Guiqing; Alwan, Nisreen A. [JOURNAL]: PLoS One [ABSTRACT]: BACKGROUND: Long Covid is a public health concern that needs defining, quantifying, and describing. We aimed to explore the initial and ongoing symptoms of Long Covid following SARS-CoV-2 infection and describe its impact on daily life. METHODS: We collected self-reported data through an online survey using convenience non-probability sampling. The survey enrolled adults who reported lab-confirmed (PCR or antibody) or suspected COVID-19 who were not hospitalised in the first two weeks of illness. This analysis was restricted to those with self-reported Long Covid. Univariate comparisons between those with and without confirmed COVID-19 infection were carried out and agglomerative hierarchical clustering was used to identify specific symptom clusters, and their demographic and functional correlates. RESULTS: We analysed data from 2550 participants with a median duration of illness of 7.6 months (interquartile range (IQR) 7.1–7.9). 26.5% reported lab-confirmation of infection. The mean age was 46.5 years (standard deviation 11 years) with 82.8% females and 79.9% of participants based in the UK. 89.5% described their health as good, very good or excellent before COVID-19. The most common initial symptoms that persisted were exhaustion, chest pressure/tightness, shortness of breath and headache. Cognitive dysfunction and palpitations became more prevalent later in the illness. Most participants described fluctuating (57.7%) or relapsing symptoms (17.6%). Physical activity, stress, and sleep disturbance commonly triggered symptoms. A third (32%) reported they were unable to live alone without any assistance at six weeks from start of illness. 16.9% reported being unable to work solely due to COVID-19 illness. 37.0% reported loss of income due to illness, and 64.4% said they were unable to perform usual activities/duties. Acute systems clustered broadly into two groups: a majority cluster (n = 2235, 88%) with cardiopulmonary predominant symptoms, and a minority cluster (n = 305, 12%) with multisystem symptoms. Similarly, ongoing symptoms broadly clustered in two groups; a majority cluster (n = 2243, 88.8%) exhibiting mainly cardiopulmonary, cognitive symptoms and exhaustion, and a minority cluster (n = 283, 11.2%) exhibiting more multisystem symptoms. Belonging to the more severe multisystem cluster was associated with more severe functional impact, lower income, younger age, being female, worse baseline health, and inadequate rest in the first two weeks of the illness, with no major differences in the cluster patterns when restricting analysis to the lab-confirmed subgroup. CONCLUSION: This is an exploratory survey of Long Covid characteristics. Whilst this is a non-representative population sample, it highlights the heterogeneity of persistent symptoms, and the significant functional impact of prolonged illness following confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. To study prevalence, predictors and prognosis, research is needed in a representative population sample using standardised case definitions.', '[TITLE]: Persistent neurologic symptoms and cognitive dysfunction in non‐hospitalized Covid‐19 “long haulers” [AUTHORS]: Graham, Edith L.; Clark, Jeffrey R.; Orban, Zachary S.; Lim, Patrick H.; Szymanski, April L.; Taylor, Carolyn; DiBiase, Rebecca M.; Jia, Dan Tong; Balabanov, Roumen; Ho, Sam U.; Batra, Ayush; Liotta, Eric M.; Koralnik, Igor J. [JOURNAL]: Ann Clin Transl Neurol [ABSTRACT]: OBJECTIVE: Most SARS‐CoV‐2‐infected individuals never require hospitalization. However, some develop prolonged symptoms. We sought to characterize the spectrum of neurologic manifestations in non‐hospitalized Covid‐19 “long haulers”. METHODS: This is a prospective study of the first 100 consecutive patients (50 SARS‐CoV‐2 laboratory‐positive (SARS‐CoV‐2(+)) and 50 laboratory‐negative (SARS‐CoV‐2(‐)) individuals) presenting to our Neuro‐Covid‐19 clinic between May and November 2020. Due to early pandemic testing limitations, patients were included if they met Infectious Diseases Society of America symptoms of Covid‐19, were never hospitalized for pneumonia or hypoxemia, and had neurologic symptoms lasting over 6 weeks. We recorded the frequency of neurologic symptoms and analyzed patient‐reported quality of life measures and standardized cognitive assessments. RESULTS: Mean age was 43.2 ± 11.3 years, 70% were female, and 48% were evaluated in televisits. The most frequent comorbidities were depression/anxiety (42%) and autoimmune disease (16%). The main neurologic manifestations were: “brain fog” (81%), headache (68%), numbness/tingling (60%), dysgeusia (59%), anosmia (55%), and myalgias (55%), with only anosmia being more frequent in SARS‐CoV‐2(+) than SARS‐CoV‐2(‐) patients (37/50 [74%] vs. 18/50 [36%]; p < 0.001). Moreover, 85% also experienced fatigue. There was no correlation between time from disease onset and subjective impression of recovery. Both groups exhibited impaired quality of life in cognitive and fatigue domains. SARS‐CoV‐2(+) patients performed worse in attention and working memory cognitive tasks compared to a demographic‐matched US population (T‐score 41.5 [37, 48.25] and 43 [37.5, 48.75], respectively; both p < 0.01).

Our aims are to: (1) characterise disability experiences among people living with Long COVID in Canada, UK, USA and Ireland; and (2) develop a patient-reported outcome measure to assess the presence, severity and episodic nature of disability with Long COVID. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In phase 1, we will conduct semistructured interviews with adults living with Long COVID to explore experiences of disability (dimensions, uncertainty, trajectories, influencing contextual factors) and establish an episodic disability (ED) framework in the context of Long COVID (n~10 each country). Using the conceptual framework, we will establish the Long COVID Episodic Disability Questionnaire (EDQ). In phase 2, we will examine the validity (construct, structural) and reliability (internal consistency, test–retest) of the EDQ for use in Long COVID. We will electronically administer the EDQ and four health status criterion measures with adults living with Long COVID, and readminister the EDQ 1 week later (n~170 each country). We will use Rasch analysis to refine the EDQ, and confirm structural and cross-cultural validity. We will calculate Cronbach’s alphas (internal consistency reliability), and intraclass correlation coefficients (test–retest reliability), and examine correlations for hypotheses theorising relationships between EDQ and criterion measure scores (construct validity). Using phase 2 data, we will characterise the profile of disability using structural equation modelling techniques to examine relationships between dimensions of disability and the influence of intrinsic and extrinsic contextual factors. This research involves an academic–clinical–community partnership building on foundational work in ED measurement, Long COVID and rehabilitation. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved by the University of Toronto Research Ethics Board. Knowledge translation will occur with community collaborators in the form of presentations and publications in open access peer-reviewed journals and presentations.\", '[TITLE]: The negative impact of COVID-19 on working memory revealed using a rapid online quiz [AUTHORS]: Baseler, H. A.; Aksoy, M.; Salawu, A.; Green, A.; Asghar, A. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) affects the respiratory system, it can also have neurological consequences leading to cognitive deficits such as memory problems. The aim of our study was to assess the impact of COVID-19 on working memory function. We developed and implemented an online anonymous survey with a working memory quiz incorporating aspects of gamification to engage participants. 5428 participants successfully completed the survey and memory quiz between 8 th December 2020 and 5 th July 2021 (68.6% non-COVID-19 and 31.4% COVID-19). Most participants (93.3%) completed the survey and memory quiz relatively rapidly (mean time of 8.84 minutes). Categorical regression was used to assess the contribution of COVID status, age, time post-COVID (number of months elapsed since having had COVID), symptoms, ongoing symptoms and gender, followed by non-parametric statistics. A principal component analysis explored the relationship between subjective ratings and objective memory scores. The objective memory scores were significantly correlated with participants own assessment of their cognitive function. The factors significantly affecting memory scores were COVID status, age, time post-COVID and ongoing symptoms. Our main finding was a significant reduction in memory scores in all COVID groups (self-reported, positive-tested and hospitalised) compared to the non-COVID group. Memory scores for all COVID groups combined were significantly reduced compared to the non-COVID group in every age category 25 years and over, but not for the youngest age category (18-24 years old). We found that memory scores gradually increased over a period of 17 months post-COVID-19. However, those with ongoing COVID-19 symptoms continued to show a reduction in memory scores. Our findings demonstrate that COVID-19 negatively impacts working memory function, but only in adults aged 25 years and over. Moreover, our results suggest that working memory deficits with COVID-19 can recover over time, although impairments may persist in those with ongoing symptoms.', '[TITLE]: Joint Investigation of 2-Month Post-diagnosis IgG Antibody Levels and Psychological Measures for Assessing Longer Term Multi-Faceted Recovery Among COVID-19 Cases in Northern Cyprus [AUTHORS]: Barin, Burc; Yoldascan, Banu Elcin; Savaskan, Fatma; Ozbalikci, Goncagul; Karaderi, Tugce; Çakal, Hüseyin [JOURNAL]: Front Public Health [ABSTRACT]: Following the outbreak of COVID-19, multidisciplinary research focusing on the long-term effects of the COVID-19 infection and the complete recovery is still scarce. With regards to long-term consequences, biomarkers of physiological effects as well as the psychological experiences are of significant importance for comprehensively understanding the complete COVID-19 recovery. The present research surveys the IgG antibody titers and the impact of COVID-19 as a traumatic experience in the aftermath of the active infection period, around 2 months after diagnosis, in a subset of COVID-19 patients from the first wave (March-April 2020) of the outbreak in Northern Cyprus. Associations of antibody titers and psychological survey measures with baseline characteristics and disease severity were explored, and correlations among various measures were evaluated. Of the 47 serology tests conducted for presence of IgG antibodies, 39 (83%) were positive. We identified trends demonstrating individuals experiencing severe or critical COVID-19 disease and/or those with comorbidities are more heavily impacted both physiologically and mentally, with higher IgG titers and negative psychological experience compared to those with milder disease and without comorbidities. We also observed that more than half of the COVID-19 cases had negative psychological experiences, being subjected to discrimination and verbal harassment/insult, by family/friends. In summary, as the first study co-evaluating immune response together with mental status in COVID-19, our findings suggest that further multidisciplinary research in larger sample populations as well as community intervention plans are needed to holistically address the physiological and psychological effects of COVID-19 among the cases.', \"[TITLE]: Why the Patient-Made Term 'Long Covid' is needed [AUTHORS]: Perego, Elisa Callard Felicity Stras Laurie Melville-Jóhannesson Barbara Pope Rachel Alwan Nisreen [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: The patient-made term ‘Long Covid’ is, we argue, a helpful and capacious term that is needed to address key medical, epidemiological and socio-political challenges posed by diverse symptoms persisting beyond four weeks after symptom onset suggestive of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). An international movement of patients (which includes all six authors) brought the persistence and heterogeneity of long-term symptoms to widespread visibility. The same grassroots movement introduced the term ‘Long Covid’ (and the cognate term ‘long-haulers’) to intervene in relation to widespread assumptions about disease severity and duration. Persistent symptoms following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are now one of the most pressing clinical and public health phenomena to address: their cause(s) is/are unknown, their effects can be debilitating, and the percentage of patients affected is unclear, though likely significant. The term ‘Long Covid’ is now used in scientific literature, the media, and in interactions with the WHO. Uncertainty regarding its value and meaning, however, remains. In this Open Letter, we explain the advantages of the term ‘Long Covid’ and bring clarity to some pressing issues of use and definition. We also point to the importance of centring patient experience and expertise in relation to ‘Long Covid’ research, as well as the provision of care and rehabilitation.\", '[TITLE]: Long COVID-19 and Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome- Is Dysautonomia to Be Blamed? [AUTHORS]: Chadda, Karan R.; Blakey, Ellen E.; Huang, Christopher L. -H.; Jeevaratnam, Kamalan [JOURNAL]: Front Cardiovasc Med [ABSTRACT]: While the increased arrhythmic tendency during acute COVID-19 infection is recognised, the long-term cardiac electrophysiological complications are less well known. There are a high number of patients reporting ongoing symptoms post-infection, termed long COVID. A recent hypothesis is that long COVID symptoms could be attributed to dysautonomia, defined as malfunction of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The most prevalent cardiovascular dysautonomia amongst young people is postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). Numerous reports have described the development of POTS as part of long COVID. Possible underlying mechanisms, although not mutually exclusive or exhaustive, include hypovolaemia, neurotropism, inflammation and autoimmunity. Treatment options for POTS and other long COVID symptoms are currently limited. Future research studies should aim to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of dysautonomia to enable the development of targeted therapies. Furthermore, it is important to educate healthcare professionals to recognise complications and conditions arising from COVID-19, such as POTS, to allow prompt diagnosis and access to early treatment.', '[TITLE]: The Effects of Messaging on Expectations and Understanding of Long COVID: An Online Randomised Trial [AUTHORS]: Bhogal, J. K.; Mills, F.; Dennis, A.; Spoiala, C.; Milward, J.; Saeed, S.; Jones, L. F.; Weston, D.; Carter, H. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Objectives: We examined whether providing different types of information about Long COVID would affect expectations about the illness. Design: A 2 (Illness description: Long COVID vs ongoing COVID-19 recovery) x 2 (Illness uncertainty: uncertainty emphasised vs uncertainty not emphasised) x 2 (Efficacy of support: enhanced support vs basic support) between-subjects randomised online experimental study. Setting: The online platform Prolific, collected in October 2021. Participants: A representative sample of 1110 members of the public in the UK. Interventions: Participants were presented with a scenario describing a positive COVID-19 test result and then presented with one of eight scenarios describing a Long COVID diagnosis. Primary and Secondary Outcome Measures: Various outcome measures relating to illness expectations were captured including: symptom severity, symptom duration, quality of life, personal control, treatment control and illness coherence. Results: We ran a series of 2 x 2 x 2 ANOVAs on the outcome variables. We found a main effect of illness description: individuals reported longer symptom duration and less illness coherence when the illness was described as Long COVID (compared to ongoing COVID-19 recovery). There was a main effect of illness uncertainty: when uncertainty was emphasised, participants reported longer expected symptom duration, less treatment control, and less illness coherence than when uncertainty was not emphasised. There was also a main effect of efficacy of support: participants reported higher personal control and higher treatment control when support was enhanced (compared to basic support). We also found an interaction between illness description and efficacy of support: when support was enhanced, participants reported less illness coherence for Long COVID (compared to ongoing COVID-19 recovery). Conclusions: Communications around Long COVID should not emphasise symptom uncertainty and should provide people with information on how they can facilitate their recovery and where they can access additional support. The findings also suggest that use of the term ongoing COVID-19 recovery, where possible, may reduce negative expectations associated with the illness.', \"[TITLE]: Characteristics of Long Covid: findings from a social media surve [AUTHORS]: Ziauddeen, N.; Gurdasani, D.; O'Hara, M.

We aimed to explore the initial and ongoing symptoms of Long Covid following SARS-CoV-2 infection and describe its impact on daily life in people who were not admitted to hospital during the first two weeks of the illness. We co-produced a survey with people living with Long Covid. We collected the data through an online survey using convenience non-probability sampling, with the survey posted both specifically on Long Covid support groups and generally on social media. The criteria for inclusion were adults with lab-confirmed (PCR or antibody) or suspected COVID-19 managed in the community (non-hospitalised) in the first two weeks of illness.

We analysed data from 2550 participants with a median duration of illness of 7.7 months (interquartile range (IQR) 7.4-8.0). The mean age was 46.5 years (standard deviation 11 years) with 82.8% females and 79.9% of participants based in the UK. 89.5% described their health as good, very good or excellent before COVID-19. The most common initial symptoms that persisted were exhaustion, chest pressure/tightness, shortness of breath and headache. Cough, fever, and chills were common initial symptoms that became less prevalent later in the illness, whereas cognitive dysfunction and palpitations became more prevalent later in the illness. 26.5% reported lab-confirmation of infection. The biggest difference in ongoing symptoms between those who reported testing positive and those who did not was loss of smell/taste. Ongoing symptoms affected at least 3 organ systems in 83.5% of participants. Most participants described fluctuating (57.7%) or relapsing symptoms (17.6%). Physical activity, stress and sleep disturbance commonly triggered symptoms. A third (32%) reported they were unable to live alone without any assistance at six weeks from start of illness. 16.9% reported being unable to work solely due to COVID-19 illness. 66.4% reported taking time off sick (median of 60 days, IQR 20, 129). 37.0% reported loss of income due to illness, and 64.4% said they were unable to perform usual activities/duties. Acute systems clustered broadly into two groups: a majority cluster (n=2235, 88%) with cardiopulmonary predominant symptoms, and a minority cluster (n=305, 12%) with multisystem symptoms. Similarly, ongoing symptoms broadly clustered in two groups; a majority cluster (n=2243, 88.8%) exhibiting mainly cardiopulmonary, cognitive symptoms and exhaustion, and a minority cluster (n=283, 11.2%) exhibited more multisystem symptoms. Belonging to the more severe multisystem cluster was associated with more severe functional impact, lower income, younger age, being female, worse baseline health, and inadequate rest in the first two weeks of the illness, with no major differences in the cluster patterns when restricting analysis to the lab-confirmed subgroup. This is an exploratory survey of Long Covid characteristics. Whilst it is important to acknowledge that it is a non-representative population sample, it highlights the heterogeneity of persistent symptoms, and the significant functional impact of prolonged illness following confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. To study prevalence, predictors and prognosis, research is needed in a representative population sample using standardised case definitions (to include those not lab-confirmed in the first pandemic wave).\", '[TITLE]: Long COVID and its associated factors among COVID survivors in the community from a middle-income country: an online cross-sectional study [AUTHORS]: Moy, F. M.; Hairi, N. N.; Lim, E. R. J.; Bulgiba, A. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Introduction: Patients with COVID-19 usually recover and return to normal health, however some patients may have symptoms that last for weeks or even months after recovery. This persistent state of ill health is known as Long COVID if it continues for more than 12 weeks and are not explained by an alternative diagnosis. Long Covid has been overlooked in low and middle income countries. Therefore, we conducted an online survey among the COVID-19 survivors in the community to explore their Long COVID symptoms, factors associated with Long COVID and how Long COVID affected their work. Methods: This was a cross sectional study conducted from July to September 2021, during the implementation of a nationwide movement control order (MCO). Data was collected using the REDCap electronic data capture tool. The questionnaire was distributed in social and news media. The questionnaire covers information such as socio-demographic characteristics, existing comorbidities, self-perception on health, information on the acute COVID-19 condition and treatment received, symptoms and duration of post-COVID condition and effects on occupation. Results: A total of 732 COVID-19 survivors responded. There were slightly more females (58.7%), younger and more highly educated respondents. More than half of them were overweight or obese and about two third were free of comorbidities. Among these respondents, about 56% were without or with mild symptoms during their acute COVID-19 conditions. A total of 21.1% of the respondents reported to experience Long COVID. The most commonly reported symptoms for Long COVID were fatigue, brain fog, depression, anxiety, insomnia, arthralgia or myalgia. Females had 58% higher odds (95% CI: 1.02, 2.45) of experiencing Long COVID. Patients with moderate and severe levels of acute COVID-19 symptoms had OR of 3.01 (95% CI: 1.21, 7.47) and 3.62 (95% CI: 1.31, 10.03) respectively for Long COVID. Conclusion: This study provides additional insight on the symptoms and duration of post-COVID symptoms as well as the associated factors with Long COVID among COVID-19 survivors in Malaysia. Recognition of Long COVID and its associated factors is important in planning prevention, rehabilitation, clinical management to improve recovery and long-term COVID-19 outcomes.', '[TITLE]: A Systematic Review of the Protective Effect of Prior SARS-CoV-2 Infection on Repeat Infection [AUTHORS]: Kojima, N.; Shrestha, N.; Klausner, J. D. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Introduction: We systematically reviewed studies to estimate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection among those previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: For this systematic review, we searched scientific publications on PubMed and, the pre-print server, MedRxiv through August 18, 2021. Eligible studies were retrieved on August 18, 2021. We used the following search term on PubMed: (((Cohort Studies [Majr]) AND (COVID-19 [Mesh] OR SARS-CoV-2 [Mesh])) OR Reinfection [Majr]) OR Reinfection [Mesh]. We used the following search term on MedRxiv: Cohort Studies AND COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 AND Reinfection. The search terms were broad to encompass all possibilities for applicable studies. There were no restrictions on the date of publication. Studies that did not describe cohorts with estimates of the risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection among those with previous infection were excluded. Studies that included vaccinated participants were either excluded or limited to sub-groups of non-vaccinated individuals. To identify relevant studies with appropriate control groups, we developed the following criteria for studies to be included in the systematic analysis: (1) baseline polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, (2) a negative comparison group, (3) longitudinal follow-up, (4) a cohort of human participants, i.e., not a case report or case series, and (5) outcome determined by PCR. The review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. We assessed for selection, information, and analysis bias, per PRISMA guidelines. Results: We identified 1,392 reports. Of those, 10 studies were eligible for our systematic review. The weighted average risk reduction against reinfection was 90.4% with a standard deviation of 7.7%. Protection against SARS-CoV-2 reinfection was observed for up to 10 months. Studies had potential information, selection, and analysis biases. Conclusions: The protective effect of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection on re-infection is high and similar to the protective effect of vaccination. More research is needed to characterize the duration of protection and the impact of different SARS-CoV-2 variants.', '[TITLE]: Reduction of Cardiac Autonomic Modulation and Increased Sympathetic Activity by Heart Rate Variability in Patients With Long COVID [AUTHORS]: Marques, Karina Carvalho; Silva, Camilla Costa; Trindade, Steffany da Silva; Santos, Márcio Clementino de Souza; Rocha, Rodrigo Santiago Barbosa; Vasconcelos, Pedro Fernando da Costa; Quaresma, Juarez Antônio Simões; Falcão, Luiz Fábio Magno [JOURNAL]: Front Cardiovasc Med [ABSTRACT]: Although several clinical manifestations of persistent long coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been documented, their effects on the cardiovascular and autonomic nervous system over the long term remain unclear. Thus, we examined the presence of alterations in cardiac autonomic functioning in individuals with long-term manifestations. The study was conducted from October 2020 to May 2021, and an autonomic assessment was performed to collect heart rate data for the heart rate variability (HRV) analysis. The study participants were divided into the long COVID clinical group, the intragroup, which included patients who were hospitalized, and those who were not hospitalized and were symptomatic for different periods (≤3, >3, ≤6, and >6 months), with and without dyspnoea. The control group, the intergroup, comprised of COVID-free individuals. Our results demonstrated that the long COVID clinical group showed reduced HRV compared with the COVID-19-uninfected control group. Patients aged 23–59 years developed COVID symptoms within 30 days after infection, whose diagnosis was confirmed by serologic or reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (swab) tests, were included in the study. A total of 155 patients with long COVID [95 women (61.29%), mean age 43.88 ± 10.88 years and 60 men (38.71%), mean age 43.93 ± 10.11 years] and 94 controls [61 women (64.89%), mean age 40.83 ± 6.31 and 33 men (35.11%), mean age 40.69 ± 6.35 years] were included. The intragroup and intergroup comparisons revealed a reduction in global HRV, increased sympathetic modulation influence, and a decrease in parasympathetic modulation in long COVID. The intragroup showed normal sympathovagal balance, while the intergroup showed reduced sympathovagal balance. Our findings indicate that long COVID leads to sympathetic excitation influence and parasympathetic reduction. The excitation can increase the heart rate and blood pressure and predispose to cardiovascular complications. Short-term HRV analysis showed good reproducibility to verify the cardiac autonomic involvement.', '[TITLE]: Immunological dysfunction persists for 8 months following initial mild-moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection [AUTHORS]: Phetsouphanh, C.; Darley, D.; Howe, A.; Munier, C. M. L.; Patel, S. K.; Juno, J. A.; Burrell, L. M.; Kent, S. J.; Dore, G. J.; Kelleher, A. D.; Matthews, G. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: A proportion of patients surviving acute COVID-19 infection develop post-COVID syndrome (long COVID) encompassing physical and neuropsychiatric symptoms lasting longer than 12 weeks. Here we studied a prospective cohort of individuals with long COVID (the ADAPT study) compared to age/gender matched subjects without long COVID, healthy donors and individuals infected with other non-SARS CoV2 human coronaviruses (the ADAPT-C study). We found an elevated diffuse serum inflammatory cytokine profile in symptomatic long COVID subjects that was maintained at 8 months post-infection and was not observed in asymptomatic COVID-19 survivors. This inflammatory profile consisted of 15 cytokines that positively correlated; revealing an apparent diffuse, potentially coordinated, low level up regulation of a spectrum of immune and inflammatory mediators. In addition, we found an absence of subsets of un-activated naive T and B cells in peripheral blood of long COVID subjects, that did not reconstitute over time. In contrast, individual serum cytokines from the interferon I and III classes, T cell activation markers and plasma ACE2, while elevated in the serum of people previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 were not further elevated in subjects with long COVID symptoms. This work defines immunological parameters associated with long COVID and suggests future opportunities to prevention and treatment.', '[TITLE]: Long COVID and Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS)—A Systemic Review and Comparison of Clinical Presentation and Symptomatology [AUTHORS]: Wong, Timothy L.; Weitzer, Danielle J. [JOURNAL]: Medicina (Kaunas) [ABSTRACT]: Background and Objectives: Long COVID defines a series of chronic symptoms that patients may experience after resolution of acute COVID-19. Early reports from studies with patients with long COVID suggests a constellation of symptoms with similarities to another chronic medical illness—myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). A review study comparing and contrasting ME/CFS with reported symptoms of long COVID may yield mutualistic insight into the characterization and management of both conditions. Materials and Methods: A systemic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE and PsycInfo through to 31 January 2021 for studies related to long COVID symptomatology. The literature search was conducted in accordance with PRISMA methodology. Results: Twenty-one studies were included in the qualitative analysis. Long COVID symptoms reported by the included studies were compared to a list of ME/CFS symptoms compiled from multiple case definitions. Twenty-five out of 29 known ME/CFS symptoms were reported by at least one selected long COVID study. Conclusions: Early studies into long COVID symptomatology suggest many overlaps with clinical presentation of ME/CFS. The need for monitoring and treatment for patients post-COVID is evident. Advancements and standardization of long COVID research methodologies would improve the quality of future research, and may allow further investigations into the similarities and differences between long COVID and ME/CFS.', '[TITLE]: How Common is Long COVID in Children and Adolescents? [AUTHORS]: Zimmermann, Petra; Pittet, Laure F.; Curtis, Nigel [JOURNAL]: Pediatr Infect Dis J [ABSTRACT]: In children, the risk of coronavirus disease (COVID) being severe is low. However, the risk of persistent symptoms following infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is uncertain in this age group, and the features of “long COVID” are poorly characterized. We reviewed the 14 studies to date that have reported persistent symptoms following COVID in children and adolescents. Almost all the studies have major limitations, including the lack of a clear case definition, variable follow-up times, inclusion of children without confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, reliance on self- or parent-reported symptoms without clinical assessment, nonresponse and other biases, and the absence of a control group. Of the 5 studies which included children and adolescents without SARS-CoV-2 infection as controls, 2 did not find persistent symptoms to be more prevalent in children and adolescents with evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This highlights that long-term SARS-CoV-2 infection–associated symptoms are difficult to distinguish from pandemic-associated symptoms.', '[TITLE]: Case report and systematic review suggest that children may experience similar long‐term effects to adults after clinical COVID‐19 [AUTHORS]: Ludvigsson, Jonas F. [JOURNAL]: Acta Paediatr [ABSTRACT]: AIM: Persistent symptoms in adults after COVID‐19 are emerging and the term long COVID is increasingly appearing in the literature. However, paediatric data are scarce. METHODS: This paper contains a case report of five Swedish children and the long‐term symptoms reported by their parents. It also includes a systematic literature review of the MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science databases and the medRxiv/bioRxiv pre‐print servers up to 2 November 2020. RESULTS: The five children with potential long COVID had a median age of 12 years (range 9–15) and four were girls. They had symptoms for 6–8 months after their clinical diagnoses of COVID‐19. None were hospitalised at diagnosis, but one was later admitted for peri‐myocarditis. All five children had fatigue, dyspnoea, heart palpitations or chest pain, and four had headaches, difficulties concentrating, muscle weakness, dizziness and sore throats. Some had improved after 6–8 months, but they all suffered from fatigue and none had fully returned to school. The systematic review identified 179 publications and 19 of these were deemed relevant and read in detail. None contained any information on long COVID in children. CONCLUSION: Children may experience similar long COVID symptoms to adults and females may be more affected.', '[TITLE]: Chronic fatigue and post-exertional malaise in people living with long COVID [AUTHORS]: Twomey, R.; DeMars, J.; Franklin, K.; Culos-Reed, S. N.; Weatherald, J.; Wrightson, J. G. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Purpose: People living with long COVID describe a high symptom burden, and a more detailed assessment of chronic fatigue and post-exertional malaise (PEM) may inform the development of rehabilitation recommendations. The aims of this study were to use validated questionnaires to measure the severity of fatigue and compare this with normative data and thresholds for clinical relevance in other diseases; measure and describe the impact of PEM; and describe symptoms of dysfunctional breathing, self-reported physical activity/sitting time, and health-related quality of life. Methods: This was an observational study involving an online survey for adults living with long COVID (data collection from February-April, 2021) following a confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Questionnaires included the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue Scale (FACIT-F) and DePaul Symptom Questionnaire-Post-Exertional Malaise. Results: After data cleaning, n=213 participants were included in the analysis. Participants primarily identified as women (85.5%), aged 40-59 (78.4%), who had been experiencing long COVID symptoms for [≥]6 months (72.3%). The total FACIT-F score was 18{+/-}10 (where the score can range from 0-52, and a lower score indicates more severe fatigue), and 71.4% were experiencing chronic fatigue. Post-exertional symptom exacerbation affected most participants, and 58.7% met the scoring thresholds used in people living with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome. PEM occurred alongside a reduced capacity to work, be physically active, and function both physically and socially. Conclusion: Long COVID is characterized by chronic fatigue that is clinically relevant and is at least as severe as fatigue in several other clinical conditions, including cancer. PEM appears to be a common and significant challenge for the majority of this patient group. Patients, researchers, and allied health professionals are seeking information on safe rehabilitation for people living with long COVID, particularly regarding exercise. Fatigue and post-exertional symptom exacerbation must be monitored and reported in studies involving interventions for people with long COVID.', '[TITLE]: Epipharyngeal Abrasive Therapy (EAT) Has Potential as a Novel Method for Long COVID Treatment [AUTHORS]: Imai, Kazuaki; Yamano, Takafumi; Nishi, Soichiro; Nishi, Ryushiro; Nishi, Tatsuro; Tanaka, Hiroaki; Tsunoda, Toshiyuki; Yoshimoto, Shohei; Tanaka, Ayaki; Hiromatsu, Kenji; Shirasawa, Senji; Nakagawa, Takashi; Nishi, Kensuke [JOURNAL]: Viruses [ABSTRACT]: COVID-19 often causes sequelae after initial recovery, referred to collectively as long COVID. Long COVID is considered to be caused by the persistence of chronic inflammation after acute COVID-19 infection. We found that all long COVID patients had residual inflammation in the epipharynx, an important site of coronavirus replication, and some long COVID symptoms are similar to those associated with chronic epipharyngitis. Epipharyngeal abrasive therapy (EAT) is a treatment for chronic epipharyngitis in Japan that involves applying zinc chloride as an anti-inflammatory agent to the epipharyngeal mucosa. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of EAT for the treatment of long COVID. The subjects in this study were 58 patients with long COVID who were treated with EAT in the outpatient department once a week for one month (mean age = 38.4 ± 12.9 years). The intensities of fatigue, headache, and attention disorder, which are reported as frequent symptoms of long COVID, were assessed before and after EAT using the visual analog scale (VAS). EAT reduced inflammation in the epipharynx and significantly improved the intensity of fatigue, headache, and attention disorder, which may be related to myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). These results suggest that EAT has potential as a novel method for long COVID treatment.', '[TITLE]: Clearing the Fog: A Systematic Review on Cognitive Dysfunction in COVID-19 [AUTHORS]: Butardo, N. D.; Coronel, M. F. D.; Dino, A. M. O.; Mendoza, T. R. F.; Sto. Domingo, O. K. D.; Regencia, Z. J. G.; Dominguez, J. C.; Baja, E. S.; Ligsay, A. D. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Objective: The systematic review aims to examine the association between COVID-19 and cognitive dysfunction, including the link between the severity of COVID-19 and the occurrence of cognitive impairment and the potential pathophysiological mechanisms related to brain fog among COVID-19 patients. Methods: PubMed, Oxford University Press, ProQuest Health and Medical Complete, ScienceDirect, Ovid, HERDIN, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library databases were accessed to retrieve literature using the PRISMA guidelines. Results: After critical appraisal, thirteen full journal articles were included in the study. The studies showed the most frequent cognitive impairment are attention, memory, and executive function in COVID-19 patients. Compared with healthy controls (HC) in 3 out of 4 studies, cognitive impairment was only evident in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, two studies showed no correlation between brain fog and depression, and five studies showed a link between the severity of COVID-19 infection and cognitive impairment. Cases ranging from mild to severe illness presented manifestations of brain fog. However, a disparity in the evidence of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and cognitive dysfunction exists, prompting the need to investigate further. Additionally, recent studies provide insufficient evidence for direct central nervous system invasion, and there are emerging studies that contrast the presumed pathogenesis of neurological complications from neuroinflammation. Conclusion: There is an association between COVID-19 and cognitive dysfunction. Manifestation of cognitive dysfunction is present regardless of illness severity. Moreover, there are existing pathophysiological mechanisms of the Coronavirus that lead to cognitive dysfunction in COVID-19 patients; however, additional studies are required to substantiate such mechanisms further.', '[TITLE]: Persistent Lung Injury and Prothrombotic State in Long COVID [AUTHORS]: Xiang, Mengqi; Jing, Haijiao; Wang, Chengyue; Novakovic, Valerie A.; Shi, Jialan [JOURNAL]: Front Immunol [ABSTRACT]: Lung injury may persist during the recovery period of COVID-19 as shown through imaging, six-minute walk, and lung function tests. The pathophysiological mechanisms leading to long COVID have not been adequately explained. Our aim is to investigate the basis of pulmonary susceptibility during sequelae and the possibility that prothrombotic states may influence long-term pulmonary symptoms of COVID-19. The patient’s lungs remain vulnerable during the recovery stage due to persistent shedding of the virus, the inflammatory environment, the prothrombotic state, and injury and subsequent repair of the blood-air barrier. The transformation of inflammation to proliferation and fibrosis, hypoxia-involved vascular remodeling, vascular endothelial cell damage, phosphatidylserine-involved hypercoagulability, and continuous changes in serological markers all contribute to post-discharge lung injury. Considering the important role of microthrombus and arteriovenous thrombus in the process of pulmonary functional lesions to organic lesions, we further study the possibility that prothrombotic states, including pulmonary vascular endothelial cell activation and hypercoagulability, may affect long-term pulmonary symptoms in long COVID. Early use of combined anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy is a promising approach to reduce the incidence of pulmonary sequelae. Essentially, early treatment can block the occurrence of thrombotic events. Because impeded pulmonary circulation causes large pressure imbalances over the alveolar membrane leading to the infiltration of plasma into the alveolar cavity, inhibition of thrombotic events can prevent pulmonary hypertension, formation of lung hyaline membranes, and lung consolidation.', \"[TITLE]: Clinical coding of long COVID in English primary care: a federated analysis of 58 million patient records in situ using OpenSAFELY [AUTHORS]: The OpenSAFELY Collaborative,; Walker, A.

J.; Evans, S. J.; Smeeth, L.; Goldacre, B. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Background Long COVID is a term to describe new or persistent symptoms at least four weeks after onset of acute COVID-19. Clinical codes to describe this phenomenon were released in November 2020 in the UK, but it is not known how these codes have been used in practice. Methods Working on behalf of NHS England, we used OpenSAFELY data encompassing 96% of the English population. We measured the proportion of people with a recorded code for long COVID, overall and by demographic factors, electronic health record software system, and week. We also measured variation in recording amongst practices. Results Long COVID was recorded for 23,273 people. Coding was unevenly distributed amongst practices, with 26.7% of practices having not used the codes at all. Regional variation was high, ranging between 20.3 per 100,000 people for East of England (95% confidence interval 19.3-21.4) and 55.6 in London (95% CI 54.1-57.1). The rate was higher amongst women (52.1, 95% CI 51.3-52.9) compared to men (28.1, 95% CI 27.5-28.7), and higher amongst practices using EMIS software (53.7, 95% CI 52.9-54.4) compared to TPP software (20.9, 95% CI 20.3-21.4). Conclusions Long COVID coding in primary care is low compared with early reports of long COVID prevalence. This may reflect under-coding, sub-optimal communication of clinical terms, under-diagnosis, a true low prevalence of long COVID diagnosed by clinicians, or a combination of factors. We recommend increased awareness of diagnostic codes, to facilitate research and planning of services; and surveys of clinicians' experiences, to complement ongoing patient surveys.\", '[TITLE]: Similar patterns of 18F-FDG brain PET hypometabolism in paediatric and adult patients with long COVID: a paediatric case series [AUTHORS]: Morand, Aurelie Campion Jacques-Yves Lepine Anne Bosdure Emmanuelle Lucciani Léa Cammilleri Serge Chabrol Brigitte Guedj Eric [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Purpose: Several weeks after COVID-19 infection, some children report the persistence or recurrence of functional complaints. This clinical presentation has been referred as “long COVID” in the adult population, and an 18 F-FDG brain PET hypometabolic pattern has recently been suggested as a biomarker. Herein, we present a retrospective analysis of 7 paediatric patients with suspected long COVID who were explored by 18 F-FDG brain PET exam. Metabolic brain findings were confronted to those obtained in adult patients with long COVID, in comparison to their respective age-matched control groups. Methods: . Review of clinical examination, and whole-brain voxel-based analysis of 18 F-FDG PET metabolism of the 7 children in comparison to 20 paediatric controls, 35 adult patients with long COVID and 44 healthy adult subjects. Results: . Paediatric patients demonstrated a similair brain hypometabolic pattern as that found in adult long COVID patients, involving bilateral medial temporal lobes, brainstem and cerebellum (p-voxel < 0.001, p-cluster < 0.05 FWE-corrected), and also the right olfactory gyrus after small volume correction (p-voxel = 0.010 FWE-corrected), with partial recovery in two children at follow-up. Conclusion: These results provide arguments in favour of possible long COVID in children, with a similar functional brain involvement to those found in adults .', '[TITLE]: Validity of reported post-acute health outcomes in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection: a systematic review [AUTHORS]: Hirt, J.; Janiaud, P.; Gloy, V.; Schandelmaier, S.; Pereira, T. V.; Contopoulos-Ioannidis, D. G.; Goodman, S. N.; Ioannidis, J. P. A.; Munkholm, K.; Hemkens, L. G. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Importance: There is concern that post-acute SARS-CoV-2 infection health outcomes (\"post-COVID syndrome\") in children could be a serious problem but at the same time there is concern about the validity of reported associations between infection and long-term outcomes. Objective: To systematically assess the validity of reported post-acute SARS-CoV-2 infection health outcomes in children. Evidence Review: A search on PubMed and Web of Science was conducted to identify studies published up to January 22, 2022, that reported on post-acute SARS-CoV-2 infection health outcomes in children (<18 years) with a minimum follow-up of 2 months since detection of infection or 1 month since recovery from acute illness. We assessed the consideration of confounding bias and causality, and the risk of bias. Findings: 21 studies including 81,896 children reported up to 97 symptoms with follow-up periods of 2-11.5 months. Fifteen studies had no control group. The reported proportion of children with post-COVID syndrome was between 0% and 66.5% in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection (n=16,986) and 2% to 53.3% in children without SARS-CoV-2 infection (n=64,910). Only 2 studies made a clear causal interpretation of an association of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the main outcome of \"post-COVID syndrome\" and provided recommendations regarding prevention measures. Two studies mentioned potential limitations in the conclusion of the main text but none of the 21 studies mentioned any limitations in the abstract nor made a clear statement for cautious interpretation. The validity of all 21 studies was seriously limited due to an overall critical risk of bias (critical risk for confounding bias [n=21]; serious or critical risk for selection bias [n=19]; serious risk for misclassification bias [n=3], for bias due to missing data [n=14] and for outcome measurement [n=12]; and critical risk for selective reporting bias [n=16]). Conclusions and Relevance: The validity of reported post-acute SARS-CoV-2 infection health outcomes in children is critically limited. None of the studies provided evidence with reasonable certainty on whether SARS-CoV-2 infection has an impact on post-acute health outcomes, let alone to what extent. Children and their families urgently need much more reliable and methodologically robust evidence to address their concerns and improve care.', '[TITLE]: Long COVID in a prospective cohort of home-isolated patients [AUTHORS]: Blomberg, Bjørn; Mohn, Kristin Greve-Isdahl; Brokstad, Karl Albert; Zhou, Fan; Linchausen, Dagrun Waag; Hansen, Bent-Are; Lartey, Sarah; Onyango, Therese Bredholt; Kuwelker, Kanika; Sævik, Marianne; Bartsch, Hauke; Tøndel, Camilla; Kittang, Bård Reiakvam; Cox, Rebecca Jane; Langeland, Nina [JOURNAL]: Nat Med [ABSTRACT]: Long-term complications after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are common in hospitalized patients, but the spectrum of symptoms in milder cases needs further investigation. We conducted a long-term follow-up in a prospective cohort study of 312 patients—247 home-isolated and 65 hospitalized—comprising 82% of total cases in Bergen during the first pandemic wave in Norway. At 6 months, 61% (189/312) of all patients had persistent symptoms, which were independently associated with severity of initial illness, increased convalescent antibody titers and pre-existing chronic lung disease. We found that 52% (32/61) of home-isolated young adults, aged 16–30 years, had symptoms at 6 months, including loss of taste and/or smell (28%, 17/61), fatigue (21%, 13/61), dyspnea (13%, 8/61), impaired concentration (13%, 8/61) and memory problems (11%, 7/61). Our findings that young, home-isolated adults with mild COVID-19 are at risk of long-lasting dyspnea and cognitive symptoms highlight the importance of infection control measures, such as vaccination.', '[TITLE]: Humility and Acceptance: Working Within Our Limits With Long COVID and Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. [AUTHORS]: Décary, Simon; Gaboury, Isabelle; Poirier, Sabrina; Garcia, Christiane; Simpson, Scott; Bull, Michelle; Brown, Darren; Daigle, Frédérique [JOURNAL]: The Journal of orthopaedic and sports physical therapy [ABSTRACT]: SYNOPSIS The term long COVID was coined by patients to describe the long-term consequences of COVID-19. One year into the pandemic, it was clear that all patients-those hospitalized with COVID-19 and those who lived with the disease in the community-were at risk of developing debilitating sequelae that would impact their quality of life. Patients with long COVID asked for rehabilitation. Many of them, including previously healthy and fit clinicians, tried to fight postviral fatigue with exercise-based rehabilitation. We observed a growing number of patients with long COVID who experienced adverse effects from exercise therapy and symptoms strikingly similar to those of myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME). Community-based physical therapists, including those in private practice, unaware of safety issues, are preparing to help an influx of patients with long COVID. In this editorial, we expose growing concerns about long COVID and ME. We issue safety recommendations for rehabilitation and share resources to improve care for those with postviral illnesses.

Its etiology is unclear and it often follows a mild acute illness. Anecdotal reports of gradual clinical responses to histamine receptor antagonists (HRAs) suggest a histamine-dependent mechanism that is distinct from anaphylaxis, possibly mediated by T cells, which are also regulated by histamine. T cell perturbations have been previously reported in post-viral syndromes, but the T cell landscape in patients who have recovered from mild COVID-19 and its relationship to both long COVID symptoms and any symptomatic response to HRA remain underexplored. We addressed these questions in an observational study of 65 individuals who had recovered from mild COVID-19. Participants were surveyed between 87 and 408 days after the onset of acute symptoms; none had required hospitalization, 16 had recovered uneventfully, and 49 had developed long COVID. Symptoms were quantified using a structured questionnaire and T cell subsets enumerated in a standard diagnostic assay. Patients with long-COVID had reduced CD4+ and CD8+ effector memory (EM) cell numbers and increased PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1) expression on central memory (CM) cells, whereas the asymptomatic participants had reduced CD8+ EM cells only and increased CD28 expression on CM cells. 72% of patients with long COVID who received HRA reported clinical improvement, although T cell profiling did not clearly distinguish those who responded to HRA. This study demonstrates that T cell perturbations persist for several months after mild COVID-19 and are associated with long COVID symptoms.', '[TITLE]: Estimating the extent of true asymptomatic COVID-19 and its potential for community transmission: systematic review and meta-analysis [AUTHORS]: Byambasuren, O.; Cardona, M.; Bell, K.; Clark, J.; McLaws, M.-L.; Glasziou, P. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Background: The prevalence of true asymptomatic COVID-19 cases is critical to policy makers considering the effectiveness of mitigation measures against the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We aimed to synthesize all available research on the asymptomatic rates and transmission rates where possible. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane COVID-19 trials, and European PMC for pre-print platforms such as MedRxiv. We included primary studies reporting on asymptomatic prevalence where: (a) the sample frame includes at-risk population, and (b) there was sufficiently long follow up to identify pre-symptomatic cases. Meta-analysis used fixed effect and random effects models. Results: We screened 571 articles and included five low risk-of-bias studies from three countries (China (2), USA (2), Italy (1)) that tested 9,242 at-risk people, of which 413 were positive and 65 were asymptomatic. Diagnosis in all studies was confirmed using a RT-qPCR test. The proportion of asymptomatic cases ranged from 6% to 41%. Meta-analysis (fixed effect) found that the proportion of asymptomatic cases was 16% (95% CI: 12% - 20%) overall; higher in non-aged care 19% (15% - 24%), and lower in long-term aged care 8% (4% - 14%). Two studies provided direct evidence of forward transmission of the infection by asymptomatic cases but suggested lower rates than symptomatic cases. Conclusion: Our estimates of the prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases are lower than many highly publicized studies, but still substantial. Further robust epidemiological evidence is urgently needed, including in sub-populations such as children, to better understand the importance of asymptomatic cases for driving spread of the pandemic.', '[TITLE]: Neuropsychological deficits in patients with cognitive complaints after COVID‐19 [AUTHORS]: García‐Sánchez, Carmen; Calabria, Marco; Grunden, Nicholas; Pons, Catalina; Arroyo, Juan Antonio; Gómez‐Anson, Beatriz; Lleó, Alberto; Alcolea, Daniel; Belvís, Roberto; Morollón, Noemí; Mur, Isabel; Pomar, Virginia; Domingo, Pere [JOURNAL]: Brain Behav [ABSTRACT]: BACKGROUND: While much of the scientific focus thus far has been on cognitive sequelae in patients with severe COVID‐19, subjective cognitive complaints are being reported across the spectrum of disease severity, with recent studies beginning to corroborate patients’ perceived deficits. In response to this, the aims of this study were to (1) explore the frequency of impaired performance across cognitive domains in post‐COVID patients with subjective complaints and (2) uncover whether impairment existed within a single domain or across multiple. METHODS: Sixty‐three patients with subjective cognitive complaints post‐COVID were assessed with a comprehensive protocol consisting of various neuropsychological tests and mood measures. Cognitive test performance was transformed into T scores and classified based on recommended guidelines. After performing a principal component analysis to define cognitive domain factors, distributions of test scores within and across domains were analyzed. RESULTS: Results revealed pervasive impact on attention abilities, both as the singularly affected domain (19% of single‐domain impairment) as well as coupled with decreased performance in executive functions, learning, and long‐term memory. These salient attentional and associated executive deficits were largely unrelated to clinical factors such as hospitalization, disease duration, biomarkers, or affective measures. DISCUSSION: These findings stress the importance of comprehensive evaluation and intervention to address cognitive sequelae in post‐COVID patients of varying disease courses, not just those who were hospitalized or experienced severe symptoms. Future studies should investigate to what extent these cognitive abilities are recuperated over time as well as employ neuroimaging techniques to uncover underlying mechanisms of neural damage.', '[TITLE]: Post-acute COVID-19 Syndrome Negatively Impacts Physical Function, Cognitive Function, Health-Related Quality of Life, and Participation [AUTHORS]: Tabacof, Laura; Tosto-Mancuso, Jenna; Wood, Jamie; Cortes, Mar; Kontorovich, Amy; McCarthy, Dayna; Rizk, Dahlia; Rozanski, Gabriela; Breyman, Erica; Nasr, Leila; Kellner, Christopher; Herrera, Joseph E.; Putrino, David [JOURNAL]: Am J Phys Med Rehabil [ABSTRACT]: This report describes persistent symptoms associated with post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS) and the impact of these symptoms on physical function, cognitive function, health-related quality of life, and participation. DESIGN: This study used a cross-sectional observational study design. Patients attending Mount Sinai’s post-acute COVID-19 syndrome clinic completed surveys containing patient-reported outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 156 patients completed the survey, at a median (range) time of 351 days (82–457 days) after COVID-19 infection. All patients were prevaccination. The most common persistent symptoms reported were fatigue (n = 128, 82%), brain fog (n = 105, 67%), and headache (n = 94, 60%). The most common triggers of symptom exacerbation were physical exertion (n = 134, 86%), stress (n = 107, 69%), and dehydration (n = 77, 49%). Increased levels of fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale) and dyspnea (Medical Research Council) were reported, alongside reductions in levels of regularly completed physical activity. Ninety-eight patients (63%) scored for at least mild cognitive impairment (Neuro-Qol), and the domain of the EuroQol: 5 dimension, 5 level most impacted was Self-care, Anxiety/Depression and Usual Activities. CONCLUSIONS: Persistent symptoms associated with post-acute COVID-19 syndrome seem to impact physical and cognitive function, health-related quality of life, and participation in society. More research is needed to further clarify the relationship between COVID-19 infection and post-acute COVID-19 syndrome symptoms, the underlying mechanisms, and treatment options.', '[TITLE]: A systematic review of the impact of intensive care admissions on post discharge cognition in children [AUTHORS]: Royer, Ana Sánchez-Moreno; Busari, Jamiu O. [JOURNAL]: Eur J Pediatr [ABSTRACT]: Understanding how hospitalization affects cognitive development is crucial to safeguard children’s cognition; however, there is little research evaluating the associations between NICU or PICU hospitalization and survivors’ cognition. The objective of this study is to identify and characterize the associations between a neonatal or pediatric ICU hospitalization and the short- and long-term cognition of survivors. The databases Cochrane Library, Medline, EBSCO, Embase, and Google Scholar and the journals JAMA Pediatrics, Journal of Pediatrics, Pediatrics, Archives of Disease in Childhood, Academic Pediatrics, Pediatric Critical Care Medicine and Child Development were searched until April 2021. Retrieved article references were analyzed. Included articles investigated cognition as an outcome of ICU hospitalization in non-preterm neonatal or pediatric patients. Case studies and studies analyzing diagnosis or treatment interventions were excluded. Four prospective cohort or case-control studies and two retrospective cohort studies were included, totaling 2172 neonatal and 42368 pediatric patients. Quality assessment using the BMJ Criteria and Cochrane Collaboration’s Risk-of-Bias tool displayed good results. Significant negative associations were found between neonatal cognition and length-of-ICU-stay at 9- (p<0.001) and 24 months (p<0.01), and between pediatric cognition and length-of-ICU-stay at discharge (p<0.001). Additional weeks on the neonatal ICU increased odds of impairment at 9- (OR 1.08, 95%CI 1.034–1.112) and 24 months (OR 1.11, 95%CI 1.065–1.165). Conclusion: There is a significant negative correlation between NICU and PICU hospitalization and the short- and long-term cognitive status. Future research must identify patient- and hospital-related risk factors and develop management strategies.', \"[TITLE]: Multivariate profile and acute-phase correlates of cognitive deficits in a COVID-19 hospitalised cohort [AUTHORS]: Hampshire, Adam; Chatfield, Doris A.; MPhil, Anne Manktelow; Jolly, Amy; Trender, William; Hellyer, Peter J.; Giovane, Martina Del; Newcombe, Virginia F.J.; Outtrim, Joanne G.; Warne, Ben; Bhatti, Junaid; Pointon, Linda; Elmer, Anne; Sithole, Nyarie; Bradley, John; Kingston, Nathalie; Sawcer, Stephen J.; Bullmore, Edward T.; Rowe, James B.; Menon, David K. [JOURNAL]: EClinicalMedicine [ABSTRACT]: BACKGROUND: Preliminary evidence has highlighted a possible association between severe COVID-19 and persistent cognitive deficits. Further research is required to confirm this association, determine whether cognitive deficits relate to clinical features from the acute phase or to mental health status at the point of assessment, and quantify rate of recovery. METHODS: 46 individuals who received critical care for COVID-19 at Addenbrooke's hospital between 10th March 2020 and 31st July 2020 (16 mechanically ventilated) underwent detailed computerised cognitive assessment alongside scales measuring anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder under supervised conditions at a mean follow up of 6.0 (± 2.1) months following acute illness. Patient and matched control (N = 460) performances were transformed into standard deviation from expected scores, accounting for age and demographic factors using N = 66,008 normative datasets. Global accuracy and response time composites were calculated (G_SScore & G_RT). Linear modelling predicted composite score deficits from acute severity, mental-health status at assessment, and time from hospital admission. The pattern of deficits across tasks was qualitatively compared with normal age-related decline, and early-stage dementia. FINDINGS: COVID-19 survivors were less accurate (G_SScore=-0.53SDs) and slower (G_RT=+0.89SDs) in their responses than expected compared to their matched controls. Acute illness, but not chronic mental health, significantly predicted cognitive deviation from expected scores (G_SScore (p=\\u200b\\u200b0.0037) and G_RT (p = 0.0366)). The most prominent task associations with COVID-19 were for higher cognition and processing speed, which was qualitatively distinct from the profiles of normal ageing and dementia and similar in magnitude to the effects of ageing between 50 and 70 years of age. A trend towards reduced deficits with time from illness (r∼=0.15) did not reach statistical significance. INTERPRETATION: Cognitive deficits after severe COVID-19 relate most strongly to acute illness severity, persist long into the chronic phase, and recover slowly if at all, with a characteristic profile highlighting higher cognitive functions and processing speed.

[AUTHORS]: Cools, Roshan; Arnsten, Amy F T [JOURNAL]: Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology [ABSTRACT]: The primate prefrontal cortex (PFC) subserves our highest order cognitive operations, and yet is tremendously dependent on a precise neurochemical environment for proper functioning. Depletion of noradrenaline and dopamine, or of acetylcholine from the dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC), is as devastating as removing the cortex itself, and serotonergic influences are also critical to proper functioning of the orbital and medial PFC. Most neuromodulators have a narrow inverted U dose response, which coordinates arousal state with cognitive state, and contributes to cognitive deficits with fatigue or uncontrollable stress. Studies in monkeys have revealed the molecular signaling mechanisms that govern the generation and modulation of mental representations by the dlPFC, allowing dynamic regulation of network strength, a process that requires tight regulation to prevent toxic actions, e.g., as occurs with advanced age. Brain imaging studies in humans have observed drug and genotype influences on a range of cognitive tasks and on PFC circuit functional connectivity, e.g., showing that catecholamines stabilize representations in a baseline-dependent manner. Research in monkeys has already led to new treatments for cognitive disorders in humans, encouraging future research in this important field.', '[TITLE]: SARS-CoV-2 is associated with changes in brain structure in UK Biobank [AUTHORS]: Douaud, Gwenaëlle; Lee, Soojin; Alfaro-Almagro, Fidel; Arthofer, Christoph; Wang, Chaoyue; McCarthy, Paul; Lange, Frederik; Andersson, Jesper L. R.; Griffanti, Ludovica; Duff, Eugene; Jbabdi, Saad; Taschler, Bernd; Keating, Peter; Winkler, Anderson M.; Collins, Rory; Matthews, Paul M.; Allen, Naomi; Miller, Karla L.; Nichols, Thomas E.; Smith, Stephen M. [JOURNAL]: Nature [ABSTRACT]: There is strong evidence of brain-related abnormalities in COVID-19(1–13). However, it remains unknown whether the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection can be detected in milder cases, and whether this can reveal possible mechanisms contributing to brain pathology. Here we investigated brain changes in 785 participants of UK Biobank (aged 51–81 years) who were imaged twice using magnetic resonance imaging, including 401 cases who tested positive for infection with SARS-CoV-2 between their two scans—with 141 days on average separating their diagnosis and the second scan—as well as 384 controls. The availability of pre-infection imaging data reduces the likelihood of pre-existing risk factors being misinterpreted as disease effects. We identified significant longitudinal effects when comparing the two groups, including (1) a greater reduction in grey matter thickness and tissue contrast in the orbitofrontal cortex and parahippocampal gyrus; (2) greater changes in markers of tissue damage in regions that are functionally connected to the primary olfactory cortex; and (3) a greater reduction in global brain size in the SARS-CoV-2 cases. The participants who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 also showed on average a greater cognitive decline between the two time points. Importantly, these imaging and cognitive longitudinal effects were still observed after excluding the 15 patients who had been hospitalised. These mainly limbic brain imaging results may be the in vivo hallmarks of a degenerative spread of the disease through olfactory pathways, of neuroinflammatory events, or of the loss of sensory input due to anosmia. Whether this deleterious effect can be partially reversed, or whether these effects will persist in the long term, remains to be investigated with additional follow-up.', '[TITLE]: Are vaccines safe in patients with Long COVID? A prospective observational study. [AUTHORS]: Arnold, D. T.; Milne, A.; Stadon, L.; Maskell, N. A.; Hamilton, F. W. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Introduction: Although the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination to prevent symptomatic COVID-19 is well established, there are no published studies on the impact on symptoms in patients with Long Covid. Anecdotal reports have suggested both a potential benefit and worsening of symptoms post vaccination with the uncertainty leading to some vaccine hesitancy amongst affected individuals. Methods: Patients initially hospitalised with COVID-19 were prospectively recruited to an observational study with clinical follow-up at 3 months (June-July 2020) and 8 months (Dec 2020-Jan 2021) post-admission. Participants who received the Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) or Oxford-AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) vaccine between January to February 2021 were identified and matched 2:1 (in terms of 8-month symptoms) with participants from the same cohort who were unvaccinated. All were re-assessed at 1 month post vaccination (or matched timepoint for unvaccinated cohort). Validated quality of life (SF-36), mental wellbeing (WEMWBS) and ongoing symptoms were assessed at all timepoints. Formal statistical analysis compared the effect of vaccination on recent quality of life using baseline symptoms, age, and gender in linear regression. Results: Forty-four vaccinated participants were assessed at a median of 32 days (IQR 20-41) post vaccination with 22 matched unvaccinated participants. Most were highly symptomatic of Long Covid at 8 months (82% in both groups had at least 1 persistent symptom), with fatigue (61%), breathlessness (50%) and insomnia (38%) predominating. There was no significant worsening in quality-of-life or mental wellbeing metrics pre versus post vaccination. Nearly two-thirds (n=27) reported transient (<72hr duration) systemic effects (including fever, myalgia and headache). When compared to matched unvaccinated participants from the same cohort, those who had receive a vaccine had a small overall improvement in Long Covid symptoms, with a decrease in worsening symptoms (5.6% vaccinated vs 14.2% unvaccinated) and increase in symptom resolution (23.2% vaccinated vs 15.4% unvaccinated) (p=0.035). No difference in response was identified between Pfizer-BioNTech or Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines. Conclusions: Receipt of vaccination with either an mRNA or adenoviral vector vaccine was not associated with a worsening of Long Covid symptoms, quality of life, or mental wellbeing. Individuals with prolonged COVID-19 symptoms should receive vaccinations as suggested by national guidance.', '[TITLE]: Survivorship after COVID-19 ICU stay [AUTHORS]: Hosey, Megan M.; Needham, Dale M.

[AUTHORS]: Henry, Rebecca J; Ritzel, Rodney M; Barrett, James P; Doran, Sarah J; Jiao, Yun; Leach, Jennie B; Szeto, Gregory L; Wu, Junfang; Stoica, Bogdan A; Faden, Alan I; Loane, David J [JOURNAL]: The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience [ABSTRACT]: Chronic neuroinflammation with sustained microglial activation occurs following severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and is believed to contribute to subsequent neurodegeneration and neurological deficits . Microglia, the primary innate immune cells in brain, are dependent on colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) signaling for their survival. In this pre-clinical study, we examined the effects of delayed depletion of chronically activated microglia on functional recovery and neurodegeneration up to three months post-injury. A CSF1R inhibitor, PLX5622, was administered to adult male C57Bl/6J mice at one month after controlled cortical impact to remove chronically activated microglia, and the inhibitor was withdrawn 1-week later to allow for microglial repopulation. Following TBI, the repopulated microglia displayed a ramified morphology similar to that of sham uninjured mice, whereas microglia in vehicle-treated TBI mice showed the typical chronic posttraumatic hypertrophic morphology. PLX5622 treatment limited TBI-associated neuropathological changes at 3 months post-injury; these included a smaller cortical lesion, reduced hippocampal neuron cell death, and decreased NOX2- and NLRP3 inflammasome-associated neuroinflammation. Furthermore, delayed depletion of chronically activated microglia after TBI led to widespread changes in the cortical transcriptome and altered gene pathways involved in neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and neuroplasticity. Using a variety of complementary neurobehavioral tests, PLX5622-treated TBI mice also had improved long-term motor and cognitive function recovery through 3 months post-injury. Together, these studies demonstrate that chronic phase removal of neurotoxic microglia after TBI using CSF1R inhibitors markedly reduce chronic neuroinflammation and associated neurodegeneration, as well as related motor and cognitive deficits.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTTraumatic brain injury (TBI) is a debilitating neurological disorder that can seriously impact the patient's quality of life. Microglial-mediated neuroinflammation is induced after severe TBI and contributes to neurological deficits and on-going neurodegenerative processes. Here, we investigated the effect of breaking the neurotoxic neuroinflammatory loop at 1-month after controlled cortical impact in mice by pharmacological removal of chronically activated microglia using a CSF1R inhibitor, PLX5622. Overall, we show that short-term elimination of microglia during the chronic phase of TBI followed by repopulation results in long-term improvements in neurological function, suppression of neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress pathways, and a reduction in persistent neurodegenerative processes. These studies are clinically relevant and support new concepts that the therapeutic window for TBI may be far longer than traditionally believed if chronic and evolving microglial-mediated neuroinflammation can be inhibited or regulated in a precise manner.\", '[TITLE]: Changes in cognitive functioning after COVID‐19: A systematic review and meta‐analysis [AUTHORS]: Crivelli, Lucia; Palmer, Katie; Calandri, Ismael; Guekht, Alla; Beghi, Ettore; Carroll, William; Frontera, Jennifer; García‐Azorín, David; Westenberg, Erica; Winkler, Andrea Sylvia; Mangialasche, Francesca; Allegri, Ricardo F.; Kivipelto, Miia [JOURNAL]: Alzheimers Dement [ABSTRACT]: INTRODUCTION: We conducted a systematic review and meta‐analysis of the cognitive effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) in adults with no prior history of cognitive impairment. METHODS: Searches in Medline/Web of Science/Embase from January 1, 2020, to December 13, 2021, were performed following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A meta‐analysis of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) total score comparing recovered COVID‐19 and healthy controls was performed. RESULTS: Oof 6202 articles, 27 studies with 2049 individuals were included (mean age = 56.05 years, evaluation time ranged from the acute phase to 7 months post‐infection). Impairment in executive functions, attention, and memory were found in post‐COVID‐19 patients. The meta‐analysis was performed with a subgroup of 290 individuals and showed a difference in MoCA score between post‐COVID‐19 patients versus controls (mean difference = −0.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] −1.59, −0.29; P = .0049).

[JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Objectives: Dogs can be trained to identify several substances not detected by humans, corresponding to specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The presence of VOCs, triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection, was tested in sweat from Long COVID patients. Patients and methods: An axillary sweat sample of Long COVID patients and of COVID-19 negative, asymptomatic individuals was taken at home to avoid any hospital contact. Swabs were randomly placed in olfaction detection cones, and the material sniffed by at least 2 trained dogs. Results: Forty-five Long COVID patients, mean age 45 (6-71), 73.3% female, with prolonged symptoms evolving for a mean of 15.2 months (5-22) were tested. Dogs discriminated in a positive way 23/45 (51.1%) Long COVID patients versus 0/188 (0%) control individuals (p<.0001).

In this longitudinal study we present symptoms registered during the acute phase as well as long COVID, i.e. long-lasting COVID-19 symptoms, in patients from the Faroe Islands. METHODS: All consecutive patients with confirmed RT-PCR testing from April to June 2020 were invited to participate in this study for the assessment of long COVID. Demographic and clinical characteristics and self-reported acute and persistent symptoms were assessed using a standardized detailed questionnaire administered at enrollment and at repeated phone interviews in the period 22 (th) April to Aug 16 (th). RESULTS: Of the 180 participants (96.3% of the 187 eligible COVID-19 patients), 53.1% reported persistence of at least one symptom after a mean of 125 days after symptoms onset, 33.3% reported one or two symptoms and 19.4% three or more symptoms. At the last follow-up, 46.7% were asymptomatic compared with 4.4 % during the acute phase. The most prevalent persistent symptoms were fatigue, loss of smell and taste, and arthralgias. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that it might take months for symptoms to resolve, even among non-hospitalized persons with mild illness course in the acute phase. Continued monitoring for long COVID is needed.', '[TITLE]: Long term outcomes in survivors of epidemic Influenza A (H7N9) virus infection [AUTHORS]: Chen, Jiajia; Wu, Jie; Hao, Shaorui; Yang, Meifang; Lu, Xiaoqing; Chen, Xiaoxiao; Li, Lanjuan [JOURNAL]: Sci Rep [ABSTRACT]: Patients who survive influenza A (H7N9) virus infection are at risk of physical and psychological complications of lung injury and multi-organ dysfunction. However, there were no prospectively individualized assessments of physiological, functional and quality-of-life measures after hospital discharge. The current study aims to assess the main determinants of functional disability of these patients during the follow-up. Fifty-six influenza A (H7N9) survivors were investigated during the 2-year after discharge from the hospital. Results show interstitial change and fibrosis on pulmonary imaging remained 6 months after hospital discharge. Both ventilation and diffusion dysfunction improved, but restrictive and obstructive patterns on ventilation function test persisted throughout the follow-up period. For patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome lung functions improved faster during the first six months. Role-physical and Role-emotional domains in the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey were worse than those of a sex- and age-matched general population group. The quality of life of survivors with ARDS was lower than those with no ARDS. Our findings suggest that pulmonary function and imaging findings improved during the first 6 months especially for those with ARDS, however long-term lung disability and psychological impairment in H7N9 survivors persisted at 2 years after discharge from the hospital.', '[TITLE]: Prevalence, characteristics, and predictors of Long COVID among diagnosed cases of COVID-19 [AUTHORS]: M C, A.; Singh, A. K.; Pal, D.; Das, K.; Gajjala, A.; Venkateshan, M.; Mishra, B.; Patro, B. K.; Mohapatra, P. R.; Subba, S. H. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Background: Long COVID or long-term complication after COVID-19 has the ability to affect health and quality of life. Knowledge about the burden and predictors could aid in their prevention and management. Most of the studies are from high-income countries and focus on severe cases. We did this study to estimate the prevalence and identify the characteristics and predictors of Long COVID among our patients. Methodology: We recruited adult ([≥]18 years) patients who were diagnosed as Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RTPCR) confirmed SARS-COV-2 infection and were either hospitalized or tested on outpatient basis. Eligible participants were followed up telephonically after four weeks of diagnosis of SARS-COV-2 infection to collect data on sociodemographic, clinical history, vaccination history, Cycle threshold (Ct) values during diagnosis and other variables. Characteristic of Long COVID were elicited, and multivariable logistic regression was done to find the predictors of Long COVID. Results: We have analyzed 487 individual data with a median follow-up of 44 days (Inter quartile range (IQR): 39,47). Overall, Long COVID was reported by 29.2% (95% Confidence interval (CI): 25.3%,33.4%) participants. Prevalence of Long COVID among patients with mild/moderate disease (n = 415) was 23.4% (95% CI: 19.5%,27.7%) as compared to 62.5% (95% CI: 50.7%,73%) in severe/critical cases(n=72). The most common Long COVID symptom was fatigue (64.8%) followed by cough (32.4%). Statistically significant predictors of Long COVID were - Pre-existing medical conditions (Adjusted Odds ratio (aOR)=2.00, 95% CI: 1.16,3.44), having a more significant number of symptoms during acute phase of COVID-19 disease (aOR=11.24, 95% CI: 4.00,31.51), two doses of COVID-19 vaccination (aOR=2.32, 95% CI: 1.17,4.58), the severity of illness (aOR=5.71, 95% CI: 3.00,10.89) and being admitted to hospital (Odds ratio (OR)=3.89, 95% CI: 2.49,6.08). Conclusion: A considerable proportion of COVID-19 cases reported Long COVID symptoms. More research is needed in Long COVID to objectively assess the symptoms and find the biological and radiological markers.', '[TITLE]: The prevalence of adaptive immunity to COVID-19 and reinfection after recovery, a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of 12 011 447 individuals [AUTHORS]: Chivese, T.; Matizanadzo, J.; Musa, O.; Hindy, G.; Furuya-Kanamori, L.; Islam, N.; Al-Shebly, R.; Shalaby, R.; Habibullah, M.; Al-Marwani, T.; Hourani, R. F.; Nawaz, A. D.; Haider, M.; Emara, M. M.; Cyprian, F.; Doi, S. A. R. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Abstract Objectives This study aims to estimate the prevalence and longevity of detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as well as T and B memory cells during infection with SARS-CoV-2 and after recovery. In addition, prevalence of COVID-19 reinfection, and the preventive efficacy of previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 were investigated. Methods and analyses A synthesis of existing research was conducted. The Cochrane Library for COVID-19 resources, the China Academic Journals Full Text Database, PubMed, and Scopus as well as preprint servers were searched for studies conducted between 1 January 2020 to 1 April 2021. We included studies with the relevant outcomes of interest. All included studies were assessed for methodological quality and pooled estimates of relevant outcomes were obtained in a meta-analysis using a bias adjusted synthesis method. Proportions were synthesized with the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation and binary outcomes using the odds ratio (OR). Heterogeneity between included studies was assessed using the I2 and Cochrans Q statistics and publication bias was assessed using Doi plots. Results Fifty-four studies, from 18 countries, with a total of 12 011 447 individuals, followed up to 8 months after recovery were included. At 6-8 months after recovery, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 specific immunological memory remained high; IgG 90.4% (95%CI 72.2 to 99.9, I2=89.0%, 5 studies), CD4+ 91.7% (95%CI 78.2 to 97.1, one study), and memory B cells 80.6% (95%CI 65.0 to 90.2, one study) and the pooled prevalence of reinfection was 0.2% (95%CI 0.0 to 0.7, I2 = 98.8, 9 studies). Individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 had an 81% reduction in odds of a reinfection (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.3, I2 = 90.5%, 5 studies). Conclusion Around 90% of people previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 had evidence of immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2, which was sustained for at least 6-8 months after recovery, and had a low risk of reinfection.', '[TITLE]: Depressive symptoms in response to COVID-19 and lockdown: a cross-sectional study on the Italian population [AUTHORS]: Delmastro, Marco; Zamariola, Giorgia [JOURNAL]: Sci Rep [ABSTRACT]: The COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown orders adopted to prevent the spread of the disease had a huge impact on a personal, social, and economic level for the world population. In Europe, Italy was one of the frontrunner countries dealing with an emergency that significantly affected people’s lives. Previous research on the psychological impact of the pandemic revealed an increase in anxiety, depression, and feelings of distress; however, these studies were conducted on non-representative samples of the population reached through social media channels, a method that is likely to lead to many forms of statistical and methodological bias. For the first time to our knowledge, we assessed the psychological impact of COVID-19 on 6700 Italian individuals, representative of the Italian population in terms of age, gender, and geographical areas revealing higher scores of depressive symptoms in females, younger adults, people reporting professional uncertainty and lower socio-economic status. A positive correlation was also found for individuals living alone, those who could not leave home for going to work, and people with a case of COVID-19 in the family, whereas the region of residence was not a significant predictor of depressive symptoms. These findings underline the importance of considering the psychological effects of COVID-19 and providing support to individuals seeking mental health care.', '[TITLE]: The impact of COVID-19 on people ageing with an intellectual disability in Ireland: Protocol for a follow-up survey [AUTHORS]: McCarron, Mary; Allen, Andrew; McCausland, Darren; Haigh, Margaret; Luus, Retha; Bavussantakath, Fathima Rosmin; Sheerin, Fintan; Mulryan, Niamh; Burke, Eilish; McGlinchey, Eimear; Flannery, Fidelma; McCallion, Philip [JOURNAL]: HRB Open Res [ABSTRACT]: Background: The COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns have had a dramatic impact on many people, but individuals with an intellectual disability, given the prevalence of congregate living and high levels of co-morbid conditions, may be particularly vulnerable at this time. A prior initial survey of participants of the Intellectual Disability Supplement to the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (IDS-TILDA) found that, despite a majority of participants being tested, only a small proportion had tested positive for COVID-19. Furthermore, despite some reporting positive aspects to the lockdown, a similar proportion were experiencing stress or anxiety during the pandemic. The pandemic and lockdowns have continued, and it is possible that experiences and consequences have changed over time. Aim: To explore over time and in greater depth the impact of COVID-19 and associated lockdowns and to further establish rates of infection, rates of vaccination and participants’ experiences. Methods: A structured questionnaire for people with intellectual disability participating in the IDS-TILDA longitudinal study, to be administered by telephone/video in summer 2021. Where participants are unable to respond independently, a proxy respondent will be invited to either assist the participant or answer questions on their behalf. This questionnaire will include questions from the first COVID-19 questionnaire, with extra questions assessing “long COVID” (i.e. COVID-19 lasting for 12 weeks or longer), infection control behaviours, changes in mental health, social contacts and loneliness, frailty, healthcare, and incidence of vaccination. Impact: The results of this survey will be used to inform healthcare provision for people with intellectual disability during the latter stages of the lockdown and into the future.', '[TITLE]: Effects of Vivifrail multicomponent intervention on functional capacity: a multicentre, randomized controlled trial [AUTHORS]: Casas‐Herrero, Álvaro; Sáez de Asteasu, Mikel L.; Antón‐Rodrigo, Iván; Sánchez‐Sánchez, Juan Luis; Montero‐Odasso, Manuel; Marín‐Epelde, Itxaso; Ramón‐Espinoza, Fernanda; Zambom‐Ferraresi, Fabricio; Petidier‐Torregrosa, Roberto; Elexpuru‐Estomba, Jaione; Álvarez‐Bustos, Alejandro; Galbete, Arkaitz; Martínez‐Velilla, Nicolás; Izquierdo, Mikel [JOURNAL]: J Cachexia Sarcopenia Muscle [ABSTRACT]: BACKGROUND: Physical exercise is an effective strategy for preserving functional capacity and improving the symptoms of frailty in older adults. In addition to functional gains, exercise is considered to be a cornerstone for enhancing cognitive function in frail older adults with cognitive impairment and dementia. We assessed the effects of the Vivifrail exercise intervention for functional capacity, cognition, and well‐being status in community‐dwelling older adults. METHODS: In a multicentre randomized controlled trial conducted in three tertiary hospitals in Spain, a total of 188 older patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia (aged >75 years) were randomly assigned to an exercise intervention (n = 88) or a usual‐care, control (n = 100) group. The intervention was based on the Vivifrail tailored multicomponent exercise programme, which included resistance, balance, flexibility (3 days/week), and gait‐retraining exercises (5 days/week) and was performed for three consecutive months (http://vivifrail.com). The usual‐care group received habitual outpatient care. The main endpoint was change in functional capacity from baseline to 1 and 3 months, assessed with the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). Secondary endpoints were changes in cognitive function and handgrip strength after 1 and 3 months, and well‐being status, falls, hospital admission rate, visits to the emergency department, and mortality after 3 months. RESULTS: The Vivifrail exercise programme provided significant benefits in functional capacity over usual‐care. The mean adherence to the exercise sessions was 79% in the first month and 68% in the following 2 months. The intervention group showed a mean increase (over the control group) of 0.86 points on the SPPB scale (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.32, 1.41 points; P < 0.01) after 1 month of intervention and 1.40 points (95% CI 0.82, 1.98 points; P < 0.001) after 3 months. Participants in the usual‐care group showed no significant benefit in functional capacity (mean change of −0.17 points [95% CI −0.54, 0.19 points] after 1 month and −0.33 points [95% CI −0.70, 0.04 points] after 3 months), whereas the exercise intervention reversed this trend (0.69 points [95% CI 0.29, 1.09 points] after 1 month and 1.07 points [95% CI 0.63, 1.51 points] after 3 months). Exercise group also obtained significant benefits in cognitive function, muscle function, and depression after 3 months over control group (P < 0.05). No between‐group differences were obtained in other secondary endpoints (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The Vivifrail exercise training programme is an effective and safe therapy for improving functional capacity in community‐dwelling frail/prefrail older patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia and also seems to have beneficial effect on cognition, muscle function, and mood status.', '[TITLE]: Medium-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on multiple vital organs, exercise capacity, cognition, quality of life and mental health, post-hospital discharge [AUTHORS]: Raman, B.; Cassar, M.

R.; Harrison, P.; Pattinson, K.; Rowland, M. J. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Background The medium-term effects of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on multiple organ health, exercise capacity, cognition, quality of life and mental health are poorly understood. Methods Fifty-eight COVID-19 patients post-hospital discharge and 30 comorbidity-matched controls were prospectively enrolled for multiorgan (brain, lungs, heart, liver and kidneys) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), spirometry, six-minute walk test, cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), quality of life, cognitive and mental health assessments. Findings At 2-3 months from disease-onset, 64% of patients experienced persistent breathlessness and 55% complained of significant fatigue. On MRI, tissue signal abnormalities were seen in the lungs (60%), heart (26%), liver (10%) and kidneys (29%) of patients. COVID-19 patients also exhibited tissue changes in the thalamus, posterior thalamic radiations and sagittal stratum on brain MRI and demonstrated impaired cognitive performance, specifically in the executive and visuospatial domain relative to controls. Exercise tolerance (maximal oxygen consumption and ventilatory efficiency on CPET) and six-minute walk distance (405{+/-}118m vs 517{+/-}106m in controls, p<0.0001) were significantly reduced in patients. The extent of extra-pulmonary MRI abnormalities and exercise tolerance correlated with serum markers of ongoing inflammation and severity of acute illness. Patients were more likely to report symptoms of moderate to severe anxiety (35% versus 10%, p=0.012) and depression (39% versus 17%, p=0.036) and significant impairment in all domains of quality of life compared to controls. Interpretation A significant proportion of COVID-19 patients discharged from hospital experience ongoing symptoms of breathlessness, fatigue, anxiety, depression and exercise limitation at 2-3 months from disease-onset. Persistent lung and extra-pulmonary organ MRI findings are common. In COVID-19 survivors, chronic inflammation may underlie multiorgan abnormalities and contribute to impaired quality of life.', '[TITLE]: Immune profile of children with post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Long Covid) [AUTHORS]: Di Sante, G.; Buonsenso, D.; De Rose, C.; Valentini, P.; Ria, F.; Sanguinetti, M.; Sali, M. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: There is increasing reporting by patients organization and researchers of long covid (or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 - PASC), characterized by symptoms such as fatigue, dyspnea, chest pain, cognitive and sleeping disturbances, arthralgia and decline in quality of life. Immune system dysregulation with a hyperinflammatory state, direct viral toxicity, endothelial damage and microvascular injury have been proposed as pathologenic mechanisms. Recently, cohorts of children with PASC have been reported in Italy, Sweden and Russia. However, immunological studies of children with PASC have never been performed. In this study, we documented significant immunologic differences between children that completely recovered from acute infection and those with PASC, providing the first objective laboratory sign of the existence of PASC in children.', '[TITLE]: Clinical characteristics with inflammation profiling of Long-COVID and association with one-year recovery following hospitalisation in the UK: a prospective observational study [AUTHORS]: Evans, R. A.; Leavy, O. C.; Richardson, M.; Elneima, O.; McAuley, H. J. C.; Shikotra, A.; Singapuri, A.; Sereno, M.; Saunders, R. M.; Harris, V. C.; Aul, R.; Beirne, P.; Bolton, C. E.; Brown, J.

P.; Neubauer, S.; Openshaw, P [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Background There are currently no effective pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions for Long-COVID. To identify potential therapeutic targets, we focussed on previously described four recovery clusters five months after hospital discharge, their underlying inflammatory profiles and relationship with clinical outcomes at one year. Methods PHOSP-COVID is a prospective longitudinal cohort study, recruiting adults hospitalised with COVID-19 across the UK. Recovery was assessed using patient reported outcomes measures (PROMs), physical performance, and organ function at five-months and one-year after hospital discharge. Hierarchical logistic regression modelling was performed for patient-perceived recovery at one-year. Cluster analysis was performed using clustering large applications (CLARA) k-medoids approach using clinical outcomes at five-months. Inflammatory protein profiling from plasma at the five-month visit was performed. Findings 2320 participants have been assessed at five months after discharge and 807 participants have completed both five-month and one-year visits. Of these, 35.6% were female, mean age 58.7 (SD 12.5) years, and 27.8% received invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). The proportion of patients reporting full recovery was unchanged between five months 501/165 (25.6%) and one year 232/804 (28.9%). Factors associated with being less likely to report full recovery at one year were: female sex OR 0.68 (95% CI 0.46-0.99), obesity OR 0.50 (95%CI 0.34-0.74) and IMV OR 0.42 (95%CI 0.23-0.76). Cluster analysis (n=1636) corroborated the previously reported four clusters: very severe, severe, moderate/cognitive, mild relating to the severity of physical, mental health and cognitive impairments at five months in a larger sample. There was elevation of inflammatory mediators of tissue damage and repair in both the very severe and the moderate/cognitive clusters compared to the mild cluster including interleukin-6 which was elevated in both comparisons. Overall, there was a substantial deficit in median (IQR) EQ5D-5L utility index from pre-COVID (retrospective assessment) 0.88 (0.74-1.00), five months 0.74 (0.60-0.88) to one year: 0.74 (0.59-0.88), with minimal improvements across all outcome measures at one-year after discharge in the whole cohort and within each of the four clusters. Interpretation The sequelae of a hospital admission with COVID-19 remain substantial one year after discharge across a range of health domains with the minority in our cohort feeling fully recovered. Patient perceived health-related quality of life remains reduced at one year compared to pre-hospital admission. Systematic inflammation and obesity are potential treatable traits that warrant further investigation in clinical trials.', '[TITLE]: COVID Stress Syndrome: Clinical and Nosological Considerations [AUTHORS]: Taylor, Steven [JOURNAL]: Curr Psychiatry Rep [ABSTRACT]: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review the current state of knowledge on the newly proposed COVID Stress Syndrome. RECENT FINDINGS: The syndrome consists of five inter-correlated elements: (a) fear of SARSCoV2 infection and fear of coming into contact with objects or surfaces contaminated with the coronavirus; (b) fear of socio-economic impacts of the pandemic; (c) fear of foreigners for fear that they are infected; (d) pandemic-related compulsive checking and reassurance-seeking; and (e) pandemic-related traumatic stress symptoms. A severe form of the syndrome, characterized by clinically significant distress and impairment in functioning, is the COVID Stress Disorder, which is regarded as a pandemic-related adjustment disorder. Several treatment options exist but further research is needed. SUMMARY: Research during the COVID-19 pandemic has identified a pandemic-related adjustment disorder. The diagnosis of COVID Stress Syndrome should be made only after ruling out other disorders that could potentially account for the pattern of symptoms, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder. Further studies are needed to investigate the long-term course of the syndrome. Similar adjustment disorders may arise in future pandemics. Accordingly, understanding the COVID Stress Syndrome may facilitate efforts to understand and treat psychopathology in future pandemics.', '[TITLE]: Long COVID in Children and Adolescents: A Systematic Review and Meta-analyses. [AUTHORS]: Lopez-Leon, S.; Wegman-Ostrosky, T.; Ayuzo del Valle, N. C.; Perelman, C.; Sepulveda, R.; Rebolledo, P. A.; Cuapio, A.; Villapol, S. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Objective: To estimate the prevalence of long COVID in children and adolescents and identify the full spectrum of signs and symptoms present after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: Two independent investigators searched PubMed and Embase in order to identify observational studies that met the following criteria: 1) a minimum of 30 patients, 2) ages ranged from 0 to 18 years, 3) published in English, 4) published before February 10th, 2022, and 5) meets the National Institute for Healthcare Excellence (NICE) definition of long COVID, which consists of both ongoing (4 to 12 weeks) and post COVID 19 ([≥]12 weeks) symptoms. For COVID symptoms reported in two or more studies, random-effects meta-analyses were performed using the MetaXL software to estimate the pooled prevalence, and Review Manager (RevMan) software 5.4 was utilized to estimate the Odds Ratios (ORs) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity was assessed using I2 statistics. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviewers and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) reporting guideline was followed (registration PROSPERO CRD42021275408). Results: The literature search yielded 68 articles for long COVID in children and adolescents. After screening, 21 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the systematic review and meta-analyses. A total of 80,071 children and adolescents with COVID-19 were included. The prevalence of long COVID was 25.24% (95% CI 18.17-33.02), and the most prevalent clinical manifestations were mood symptoms (16.50%; 95% CI 7.37-28.15), fatigue (9.66%; 95% CI 4.45-16.46), and sleep disorders (8.42%; 95% CI 3.41-15.20). When compared to controls, children infected by SARS-CoV-2 had a higher risk of persistent dyspnea (OR 2.69 95%CI 2.30-3.14), anosmia/ageusia (OR 10.68, 95%CI 2.48, 46.03), and/or fever (OR 2.23, 95%CI 1.22-4.07). The main limitation of these meta-analyses is the probability of bias, which includes lack of standardized definitions, recall, selection, misclassification, nonresponse and/or loss of follow-up, and the high level of heterogeneity. Conclusion: These meta-analyses provide an overview of the broad symptomatology of long COVID in minors, which may help improve management, rehabilitation programs, and future development of guidelines and therapeutic research for COVID-19.', '[TITLE]: Persistent symptoms after Covid-19: qualitative study of 114 “long Covid” patients and draft quality principles for services [AUTHORS]: Ladds, Emma; Rushforth, Alex; Wieringa, Sietse; Taylor, Sharon; Rayner, Clare; Husain, Laiba; Greenhalgh, Trisha [JOURNAL]: BMC Health Serv Res [ABSTRACT]: BACKGROUND: Approximately 10% of patients with Covid-19 experience symptoms beyond 3–4 weeks. Patients call this “long Covid”. We sought to document such patients’ lived experience, including accessing and receiving healthcare and ideas for improving services. METHODS: We held 55 individual interviews and 8 focus groups (n = 59) with people recruited from UK-based long Covid patient support groups, social media and snowballing. We restricted some focus groups to health professionals since they had already self-organised into online communities. Participants were invited to tell their stories and comment on others’ stories. Data were audiotaped, transcribed, anonymised and coded using NVIVO. Analysis incorporated sociological theories of illness, healing, peer support, clinical relationships, access, and service redesign. RESULTS: Of 114 participants aged 27–73 years, 80 were female. Eighty-four were White British, 13 Asian, 8 White Other, 5 Black, and 4 mixed ethnicity. Thirty-two were doctors and 19 other health professionals. Thirty-one had attended hospital, of whom 8 had been admitted. Analysis revealed a confusing illness with many, varied and often relapsing-remitting symptoms and uncertain prognosis; a heavy sense of loss and stigma; difficulty accessing and navigating services; difficulty being taken seriously and achieving a diagnosis; disjointed and siloed care (including inability to access specialist services); variation in standards (e.g. inconsistent criteria for seeing, investigating and referring patients); variable quality of the therapeutic relationship (some participants felt well supported while others felt “fobbed off”); and possible critical events (e.g. deterioration after being unable to access services). Emotionally significant aspects of participants’ experiences informed ideas for improving services. CONCLUSION: Suggested quality principles for a long Covid service include ensuring access to care, reducing burden of illness, taking clinical responsibility and providing continuity of care, multi-disciplinary rehabilitation, evidence-based investigation and management, and further development of the knowledge base and clinical services.

We analysed data from 968 adult patients (5350 person-months) with a confirmed infection enroled in the ComPaRe long COVID cohort, a disease prevalent prospective e-cohort of such patients in France. Day-by-day prevalence of post COVID-19 symptoms was determined from patients’ responses to the Long COVID Symptom Tool, a validated self-reported questionnaire assessing 53 symptoms. Among patients symptomatic after 2 months, 85% still reported symptoms one year after their symptom onset. Evolution of symptoms showed a decreasing prevalence over time for 27/53 symptoms (e.g., loss of taste/smell); a stable prevalence over time for 18/53 symptoms (e.g., dyspnoea), and an increasing prevalence over time for 8/53 symptoms (e.g., paraesthesia). The disease impact on patients’ lives began increasing 6 months after onset. Our results are of importance to understand the natural history of post COVID-19 disease.', '[TITLE]: Visual interpretation of brain hypometabolism related to neurological long COVID: a French multicentric experience [AUTHORS]: Verger, Antoine; Kas, Aurélie; Dudouet, Pierre; Goehringer, François; Salmon-Ceron, Dominique; Guedj, Eric [JOURNAL]: Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging [ABSTRACT]: BACKGROUND: This multicentre study aimed to provide a qualitative and consensual description of brain hypometabolism observed through the visual analysis of (18)F-FDG PET images of patients with suspected neurological long COVID, regarding the previously reported long-COVID hypometabolic pattern involving hypometabolism in the olfactory bulbs and other limbic/paralimbic regions, as well as in the brainstem and cerebellum. METHODS: From the beginning of August 2021 to the end of October 2021, the brain (18)F-FDG PET scans of patients referred for suspected neurological long COVID with positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and/or serology tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection were retrospectively reviewed in three French nuclear medicine departments (143 patients; 47.4 years old ± 13.6; 98 women). Experienced nuclear physicians from each department classified brain (18)F-FDG PET scans according to the same visual interpretation analysis as being normal, mildly to moderately (or incompletely) affected, or otherwise severely affected within the previously reported long-COVID hypometabolic pattern. RESULTS: On the 143 brain (18)F-FDG PET scans performed during this 3-month period, 53% of the scans were visually interpreted as normal, 21% as mildly to moderately or incompletely affected, and 26% as severely affected according to the COVID hypometabolic pattern. On average, PET scans were performed at 10.9 months from symptom onset (± 4.8). Importantly, this specific hypometabolic pattern was similarly identified in the three nuclear medicine departments. Typical illustrative examples are provided to help nuclear physicians interpret long-COVID profiles. CONCLUSION: The proposed PET metabolic pattern is easily identified upon visual interpretation in clinical routine for approximately one half of patients with suspected neurological long COVID, requiring special consideration for frontobasal paramedian regions, the brainstem and the cerebellum, and certainly further adapted follow-up and medical care, while the second half of patients have normal brain PET metabolism on average 10.9 months from symptom onset.', '[TITLE]: Neurological, neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental complications of COVID-19 [AUTHORS]: Pantelis, Christos; Jayaram, Mahesh; Hannan, Anthony J; Wesselingh, Robb; Nithianantharajah, Jess; Wannan, Cassandra MJ; Syeda, Warda Taqdees; Choy, KH Christopher; Zantomio, Daniela; Christopoulos, Arthur; Velakoulis, Dennis; O’Brien, Terence J [JOURNAL]: Aust N Z J Psychiatry [ABSTRACT]: Although COVID-19 is predominantly a respiratory disease, it is known to affect multiple organ systems. In this article, we highlight the impact of SARS-CoV-2 (the coronavirus causing COVID-19) on the central nervous system as there is an urgent need to understand the longitudinal impacts of COVID-19 on brain function, behaviour and cognition. Furthermore, we address the possibility of intergenerational impacts of COVID-19 on the brain, potentially via both maternal and paternal routes. Evidence from preclinical models of earlier coronaviruses has shown direct viral infiltration across the blood–brain barrier and indirect secondary effects due to other organ pathology and inflammation. In the most severely ill patients with pneumonia requiring intensive care, there appears to be additional severe inflammatory response and associated thrombophilia with widespread organ damage, including the brain. Maternal viral (and other) infections during pregnancy can affect the offspring, with greater incidence of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, schizophrenia and epilepsy. Available reports suggest possible vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2, although longitudinal cohort studies of such offspring are needed. The impact of paternal infection on the offspring and intergenerational effects should also be considered. Research targeted at mechanistic insights into all aspects of pathogenesis, including neurological, neuropsychiatric and haematological systems alongside pulmonary pathology, will be critical in informing future therapeutic approaches. With these future challenges in mind, we highlight the importance of national and international collaborative efforts to gather the required clinical and preclinical data to effectively address the possible long-term sequelae of this global pandemic, particularly with respect to the brain and mental health.', '[TITLE]: Occurrence and transmission potential of asymptomatic and presymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections: A living systematic review and meta-analysis [AUTHORS]: Buitrago-Garcia, Diana; Egli-Gany, Dianne; Counotte, Michel J.; Hossmann, Stefanie; Imeri, Hira; Ipekci, Aziz Mert; Salanti, Georgia; Low, Nicola [JOURNAL]: PLoS Med [ABSTRACT]: BACKGROUND: There is disagreement about the level of asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We conducted a living systematic review and meta-analysis to address three questions: (1) Amongst people who become infected with SARS-CoV-2, what proportion does not experience symptoms at all during their infection? (2) Amongst people with SARS-CoV-2 infection who are asymptomatic when diagnosed, what proportion will develop symptoms later? (3) What proportion of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is accounted for by people who are either asymptomatic throughout infection or presymptomatic? METHODS AND FINDINGS: We searched PubMed, Embase, bioRxiv, and medRxiv using a database of SARS-CoV-2 literature that is updated daily, on 25 March 2020, 20 April 2020, and 10 June 2020. Studies of people with SARS-CoV-2 diagnosed by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) that documented follow-up and symptom status at the beginning and end of follow-up or modelling studies were included. One reviewer extracted data and a second verified the extraction, with disagreement resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Risk of bias in empirical studies was assessed with an adapted checklist for case series, and the relevance and credibility of modelling studies were assessed using a published checklist. We included a total of 94 studies. The overall estimate of the proportion of people who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 and remain asymptomatic throughout infection was 20% (95% confidence interval [CI] 17–25) with a prediction interval of 3%–67% in 79 studies that addressed this review question. There was some evidence that biases in the selection of participants influence the estimate. In seven studies of defined populations screened for SARS-CoV-2 and then followed, 31% (95% CI 26%–37%, prediction interval 24%–38%) remained asymptomatic. The proportion of people that is presymptomatic could not be summarised, owing to heterogeneity. The secondary attack rate was lower in contacts of people with asymptomatic infection than those with symptomatic infection (relative risk 0.35, 95% CI 0.10–1.27). Modelling studies fit to data found a higher proportion of all SARS-CoV-2 infections resulting from transmission from presymptomatic individuals than from asymptomatic individuals. Limitations of the review include that most included studies were not designed to estimate the proportion of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections and were at risk of selection biases; we did not consider the possible impact of false negative RT-PCR results, which would underestimate the proportion of asymptomatic infections; and the database does not include all sources. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this living systematic review suggest that most people who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 will not remain asymptomatic throughout the course of the infection. The contribution of presymptomatic and asymptomatic infections to overall SARS-CoV-2 transmission means that combination prevention measures, with enhanced hand hygiene, masks, testing tracing, and isolation strategies and social distancing, will continue to be needed.', '[TITLE]: Prolonged and extended impacts of SARS-CoV-2 on the olfactory neurocircuit [AUTHORS]: Kishimoto-Urata, Megumi; Urata, Shinji; Kagoya, Ryoji; Imamura, Fumiaki; Nagayama, Shin; Reyna, Rachel A.; Maruyama, Junki; Yamasoba, Tatsuya; Kondo, Kenji; Hasegawa-Ishii, Sanae; Paessler, Slobodan [JOURNAL]: Sci Rep [ABSTRACT]: The impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the olfactory pathway was studied over several time points using Syrian golden hamsters. We found an incomplete recovery of the olfactory sensory neurons, prolonged activation of glial cells in the olfactory bulb, and a decrease in the density of dendritic spines within the hippocampus. These data may be useful for elucidating the mechanism underlying long-lasting olfactory dysfunction and cognitive impairment as a post-acute COVID-19 syndrome.', '[TITLE]: Circadian rhythm disruption in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Implications for the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 [AUTHORS]: McCarthy, Michael J. [JOURNAL]: Brain Behav Immun Health [ABSTRACT]: Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a common and disabling disorder primarily characterized by persistent fatigue and exercise intolerance, with associated sleep disturbances, autonomic dysfunction, and cognitive problems. The causes of ME/CFS are not well understood but may coincide with immune and inflammatory responses following viral infections. During the current SARS-CoV2 coronavirus pandemic, ME/CFS has been increasingly reported to overlap with persistent “long COVID” symptoms, also called the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). Given the prominence of activity and sleep problems in ME/CFS, circadian rhythm disruption has been examined as a contributing factor in ME/CFS. While these studies of circadian rhythms have been pursued for decades, evidence linking circadian rhythms to ME/CFS remains inconclusive. A major limitation of older chronobiology studies of ME/CFS was the unavailability of modern molecular methods to study circadian rhythms and incomplete understanding of circadian rhythms outside the brain in peripheral organ systems. Major methodological and conceptual advancements in chronobiology have since been made. Over the same time, biomarker research in ME/CFS has progressed. Together, these new developments may justify renewed interest in circadian rhythm research in ME/CFS. Presently, we review ME/CFS from the perspective of circadian rhythms, covering both older and newer studies that make use of modern molecular methods. We focus on transforming growth factor beta (TGFB), a cytokine that has been previously associated with ME/CFS and has an important role in circadian rhythms, especially in peripheral cells. We propose that disrupted TGFB signaling in ME/CFS may play a role in disrupting physiological rhythms in sleep, activity, and cognition, leading to the insomnia, energy disturbances, cognition problems, depression, and autonomic dysfunction associated with ME/CFS. Since SARS-like coronavirus infections cause persistent changes in TGFB and previous coronavirus outbreaks have caused ME/CFS-like syndromes, chronobiological considerations may have immediate implications for understanding ME/CFS in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and possibly suggest new avenues for therapeutic interventions.', '[TITLE]: Frequent neurocognitive deficits after recovery from mild COVID-19 [AUTHORS]: Woo, Marcel S; Malsy, Jakob; Pöttgen, Jana; Zai, Susan Seddiq; Ufer, Friederike; Hadjilaou, Alexandros; Schmiedel, Stefan; Addo, Marylyn M; Gerloff, Christian; Heesen, Christoph; Schulze zur Wiesch, Julian; Friese, Manuel A [JOURNAL]: Brain Commun [ABSTRACT]: Neuropsychiatric complications associated with coronavirus disease 2019 caused by the Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) are increasingly appreciated. While most studies have focused on severely affected individuals during acute infection it remains unclear whether mild COVID-19 results in neurocognitive deficits in young patients. Here, we established a screening approach to detect cognitive deficiencies in post-COVID-19 patients. In this cross-sectional study, we recruited 18 mostly young patients 20 to 105 days (median 85 days) after recovery from mild to moderate disease who visited our outpatient clinic for post-COVID-19 care. Notably, 14 (78%) patients reported sustained mild cognitive deficits and performed worse in the Modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS-M) screening test for mild cognitive impairment compared to 10 age-matched healthy controls. While short-term memory, attention and concentration were particularly affected by COVID-19, screening results did not correlate with hospitalisation, treatment, viremia or acute inflammation. Additionally, TICS-M scores did not correlate with depressed mood or fatigue. In two severely affected patients we excluded structural or other inflammatory causes by magnetic resonance imaging, serum and cerebrospinal fluid analyses. Together, our results demonstrate that sustained subclinical cognitive impairments might be a common complication after recovery from COVID-19 in young adults, regardless of clinical course that were unmasked by our diagnostic approach.', '[TITLE]: Ribavirin antiviral combination therapy in COVID 19, a single-center experience [AUTHORS]: Singh, B. O.; Chikara, G.; Panda, P. K.; Bahurupi, Y. A.; Saha, S.; Pai, V. S. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Background COVID 19 infection has a similar clinical spectrum of disease presentation such as SARS and MERS in the past. These led to the assumption of the possibility to treat COVID 19 infection with antivirals which had been used to treat SARS and MERS. Methods A retrospective analysis was done on the data of SEV COVID Trial in symptomatic adult patients of COVID 19 infection with objectives to explore whether ribavirin antiviral combinations reduces the need of both noninvasive and invasive ventilators in treatment of COVID 19 infections. Results The patients were categorized as Cohort A consisting of 40 patients and Cohort B of 61 patients as Cohort A being the group of patients who received the standard therapy and Cohort B the group of patients who received the ribavirin combination therapy. Conclusion The study concluded that there was no statistically significant difference in regard to the need of noninvasive ventilation and invasive ventilation and also the development of multiorgan dysfunction in between the two Cohorts. Also, with progress of time, the proportion of patients with single organ dysfunctions in the two cohorts showed gradual recovery without any statistically significant differences.', \"[TITLE]: Social isolation during COVID‐19 lockdown impairs cognitive function [AUTHORS]: Ingram, Joanne; Hand, Christopher J.; Maciejewski, Greg [JOURNAL]: Appl Cogn Psychol [ABSTRACT]: Studies examining the effect of social isolation on cognitive function typically involve older adults and/or specialist groups (e.g., expeditions). We considered the effects of COVID‐19‐induced social isolation on cognitive function within a representative sample of the general population. We additionally considered how participants ‘shielding’ due to underlying health complications, or living alone, performed. We predicted that performance would be poorest under strictest, most‐isolating conditions. At five timepoints over 13 weeks, participants (N = 342; aged 18–72 years) completed online tasks measuring attention, memory, decision‐making, time‐estimation, and learning. Participants indicated their mood as ‘lockdown’ was eased. Performance typically improved as opportunities for social contact increased. Interactions between participant sub‐groups and timepoint demonstrated that performance was shaped by individuals' social isolation levels. Social isolation is linked to cognitive decline in the absence of ageing covariates. The impact of social isolation on cognitive function should be considered when implementing prolonged pandemic‐related restrictive conditions.\", \"[TITLE]: Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy for psychological distress in older adults without cognitive impairment living in nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic: A feasibility study [AUTHORS]: Ying, Yuchen; Ji, Yunxin; Kong, Fanqian; Chen, Qiqi; Lv, Yueer; Hou, Yanbin; Zhu, Lijie; Miao, Pingping; Yu, Libo; Li, Laiyou; Kuang, Wei; Jiang, Lingli; Zhu, Xiaozhuo; Liu, Xiaozhuang; Xu, Le; Mi, Yuwei; Lou, Zhongze; Ruan, Liemin [JOURNAL]: Internet Interv [ABSTRACT]: BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a detrimental effect on the mental health of older adults living in nursing homes. Very few studies have examined the effects of Internet-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (ICBT) on older adults living in nursing homes during the pandemic. We conducted a feasibility study using a single-group design, to explore the effectiveness of ICBT on psychological distress in 137 older adults (without cognitive impairment) from 8 nursing homes in 4 southeast cities in China, between January and March 2020. METHODS: Symptoms of depression, anxiety, general psychological distress, and functional disability were measured at baseline, post-treatment (5 weeks) and at a 1-month follow-up. Mixed-effects model was used to assess the effects of ICBT. RESULTS: Statistically significant changes with large effect sizes were observed from pre- to post-treatment on the PHQ-9 (p < .001, Cohen's d = 1.74), GAD-7 (p < .001, d = 1.71), GDS (p < .001, d = 1.30), K-10 (p < .001, d = 1.93), and SDS (p < .001, d = 2.03). Furthermore, improvements in treatment outcomes were sustained at 1-month follow-up, and high levels of adherence and satisfaction were indicated. CONCLUSION: ICBT was effective in reducing psychological distress in older adults without cognitive impairments living in nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, it could be applied in improving the mental health of this vulnerable group during the pandemic.\", '[TITLE]: 1-year outcomes in hospital survivors with COVID-19: a longitudinal cohort study [AUTHORS]: Huang, Lixue; Yao, Qun; Gu, Xiaoying; Wang, Qiongya; Ren, Lili; Wang, Yeming; Hu, Ping; Guo, Li; Liu, Min; Xu, Jiuyang; Zhang, Xueyang; Qu, Yali; Fan, Yanqing; Li, Xia; Li, Caihong; Yu, Ting; Xia, Jiaan; Wei, Ming; Chen, Li; Li, Yanping; Xiao, Fan; Liu, Dan; Wang, Jianwei; Wang, Xianguang; Cao, Bin [JOURNAL]: Lancet [ABSTRACT]: BACKGROUND: The full range of long-term health consequences of COVID-19 in patients who are discharged from hospital is largely unclear. The aim of our study was to comprehensively compare consequences between 6 months and 12 months after symptom onset among hospital survivors with COVID-19. METHODS: We undertook an ambidirectional cohort study of COVID-19 survivors who had been discharged from Jin Yin-tan Hospital (Wuhan, China) between Jan 7 and May 29, 2020. At 6-month and 12-month follow-up visit, survivors were interviewed with questionnaires on symptoms and health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and received a physical examination, a 6-min walking test, and laboratory tests. They were required to report their health-care use after discharge and work status at the 12-month visit. Survivors who had completed pulmonary function tests or had lung radiographic abnormality at 6 months were given the corresponding tests at 12 months. Non-COVID-19 participants (controls) matched for age, sex, and comorbidities were interviewed and completed questionnaires to assess prevalent symptoms and HRQoL. The primary outcomes were symptoms, modified British Medical Research Council (mMRC) score, HRQoL, and distance walked in 6 min (6MWD). Multivariable adjusted logistic regression models were used to evaluate the risk factors of 12-month outcomes. FINDINGS: 1276 COVID-19 survivors completed both visits. The median age of patients was 59·0 years (IQR 49·0–67·0) and 681 (53%) were men. The median follow-up time was 185·0 days (IQR 175·0–198·0) for the 6-month visit and 349·0 days (337·0–361·0) for the 12-month visit after symptom onset. The proportion of patients with at least one sequelae symptom decreased from 68% (831/1227) at 6 months to 49% (620/1272) at 12 months (p<0·0001). The proportion of patients with dyspnoea, characterised by mMRC score of 1 or more, slightly increased from 26% (313/1185) at 6-month visit to 30% (380/1271) at 12-month visit (p=0·014). Additionally, more patients had anxiety or depression at 12-month visit (26% [331/1271] at 12-month visit vs 23% [274/1187] at 6-month visit; p=0·015). No significant difference on 6MWD was observed between 6 months and 12 months. 88% (422/479) of patients who were employed before COVID-19 had returned to their original work at 12 months. Compared with men, women had an odds ratio of 1·43 (95% CI 1·04–1·96) for fatigue or muscle weakness, 2·00 (1·48–2·69) for anxiety or depression, and 2·97 (1·50–5·88) for diffusion impairment. Matched COVID-19 survivors at 12 months had more problems with mobility, pain or discomfort, and anxiety or depression, and had more prevalent symptoms than did controls. INTERPRETATION: Most COVID-19 survivors had a good physical and functional recovery during 1-year follow-up, and had returned to their original work and life. The health status in our cohort of COVID-19 survivors at 12 months was still lower than that in the control population.

The distribution of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) from bioinformatics evidence, the autopsy report for COVID-19 and the published study on sperm quality indicated COVID-19 could have a negative impact on male fertility. However, whether the negative impact of COVID-19 on male fertility is persistent remains unknown, which requires long-term follow-up investigation. Methods: Semen samples were collected from 36 male COVID-19 patients with a median recovery time of 177.5 days and 45 control subjects. Then, analysis of sperm quality and alterations of total sperm number with recovery time were performed. Results: There was no significant difference in semen parameters between male recovered patients and control subjects. And the comparisons of semen parameters between first follow-up and second follow-up revealed no significant difference. In addition, we explored the alterations of sperm count with recovery time. It showed that the group with recovery time of ≥120 and <150 days had a significantly lower total sperm number than controls while the other two groups with recovery time of ≥150 days displayed no significance with controls, and total sperm number showed a significant decline after a recovery time of 90 days and an improving trend after a recovery time of about 150 days. Conclusions: The sperm quality of COVID-19 recovered patients improved after a recovery time of nearly half a year, while the total sperm number showed an improvement after a recovery time of about 150 days. COVID-19 patients should pay close attention to the quality of semen, and might be considered to be given medical interventions if necessary within about two months after recovery, in order to improve the fertility of male patients as soon as possible.', '[TITLE]: Functional and cognitive outcomes after COVID-19 delirium [AUTHORS]: Mcloughlin, Benjamin C.; Miles, Amy; Webb, Thomas E.; Knopp, Paul; Eyres, Clodagh; Fabbri, Ambra; Humphries, Fiona; Davis, Daniel [JOURNAL]: Eur Geriatr Med [ABSTRACT]: PURPOSE: To ascertain delirium prevalence and outcomes in COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a point-prevalence study in a cohort of COVID-19 inpatients at University College Hospital. Delirium was defined by DSM-IV criteria. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 4 weeks; secondary outcomes were physical and cognitive function. RESULTS: In 71 patients (mean age 61, 75% men), 31 (42%) had delirium, of which only 12 (39%) had been recognised by the clinical team. At 4 weeks, 20 (28%) had died, 26 (36%) were interviewed by telephone and 21 (30%) remained as inpatients. Physical function was substantially worse in people after delirium − 50 out of 166 points (95% CI − 83 to − 17, p = 0.01). Mean cognitive scores at follow-up were similar and delirium was not associated with mortality in this sample. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that delirium is common, yet under-recognised. Delirium is associated with functional impairments in the medium term.

[JOURNAL]: CNS Drugs [ABSTRACT]: Preservation of cognitive function is an important outcome in oncology. Optimal patient management requires an understanding of cognitive effects of the disease and its treatment and an efficacious approach to assessment and management of cognitive dysfunction, including selection of treatments to minimize the risk of cognitive impairment. Awareness is increasing of the potentially detrimental effects of cancer-related cognitive dysfunction on functional independence and quality of life. Prostate cancer occurs most often in older men, who are more likely to develop cognitive dysfunction than younger individuals; this population may be particularly vulnerable to treatment-related cognitive disorders. Prompt identification of treatment-induced cognitive dysfunction is a crucial aspect of effective cancer management. We review the potential etiologies of cognitive decline in patients with prostate cancer, including the potential role of androgen receptor pathway inhibitors; commonly used tools for assessing cognitive function validated in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and adopted in non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer trials; and strategies for management of cognitive symptoms. Many methods are currently used to assess cognitive function. The prevalence and severity of cognitive dysfunction vary according to the instruments and criteria applied. Consensus on the definition of cognitive dysfunction and on the most appropriate approaches to quantify its extent and progression in patients treated for prostate cancer is lacking. Evidence-based guidance on the appropriate tools and time to assess cognitive function in patients with prostate cancer is required.', \"[TITLE]: What health preparations do international students make for their academic sojourn? [AUTHORS]: Gale, T.; Obasaju, T.; Brown, L. [JOURNAL]: Tourism Geographies [ABSTRACT]: The exponential growth in international student mobility since the 1990s brings issues of travel health preparedness in overseas students and the impact of studying in a foreign country on their health to the fore. The direction of travel for much 'education first' educational tourism is from less- to more-economically developed countries, yet the existing literature tends to focus on the health-related expectations, precautions and behaviours of students travelling in the other direction. We explore the health implications of the international sojourn for students in UK higher education from various developing countries, and attendant risks such as the translocation of disease (a concern elevated by the COVID-19 pandemic). Drawing on, fusing and extending ideas from research on education and health mobilities, we examine students' experiences beyond the much-discussed first few weeks after arrival which is typically understood in terms of culture shock. Using narrative research and interviews with a purposive sample of students from ten countries/territories to establish their travel health preparations and perceptions, we reveal that they made extensive use of non-medical sources of advice including family and friends, the internet and study abroad agents. When they did become ill it was an isolating, distressing and frustrating experience due to delays in obtaining a doctor's appointment and the lack of social support away from home. Of some concern, these students perceived a low risk to traveling to and studying in the UK, and had given little thought to the possibility of inadvertently transmitting disease across borders. These findings will inform our understanding of international students' health, and have the potential to shape related policy and practice in origin and destination countries alike.\", '[TITLE]: A Longitudinal Study of COVID-19 Sequelae and Immunity: Baseline Findings.

Various pathophysiologic mechanisms have been implicated in the pathogenesis of postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). OBJECTIVE To characterize medical sequelae and persistent symptoms after recovery from COVID-19 in a cohort of disease survivors and controls. DESIGN Cohort study. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04411147). SETTING National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, Bethesda, Maryland. PARTICIPANTS Self-referred adults with laboratory-documented SARS-CoV-2 infection who were at least 6 weeks from symptom onset were enrolled regardless of presence of PASC. A control group comprised persons with no history of COVID-19 or serologic evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, recruited regardless of their current health status. Both groups were enrolled over the same period and from the same geographic area. MEASUREMENTS All participants had the same evaluations regardless of presence of symptoms, including physical examination, laboratory tests and questionnaires, cognitive function testing, and cardiopulmonary evaluation. A subset also underwent exploratory immunologic and virologic evaluations. RESULTS 189 persons with laboratory-documented COVID-19 (12% of whom were hospitalized during acute illness) and 120 antibody-negative control participants were enrolled. At enrollment, symptoms consistent with PASC were reported by 55% of the COVID-19 cohort and 13% of control participants. Increased risk for PASC was noted in women and those with a history of anxiety disorder. Participants with findings meeting the definition of PASC reported lower quality of life on standardized testing. Abnormal findings on physical examination and diagnostic testing were uncommon. Neutralizing antibody levels to spike protein were negative in 27% of the unvaccinated COVID-19 cohort and none of the vaccinated COVID-19 cohort. Exploratory studies found no evidence of persistent viral infection, autoimmunity, or abnormal immune activation in participants with PASC. LIMITATIONS Most participants with COVID-19 had mild to moderate acute illness that did not require hospitalization. The prevalence of reported PASC was likely overestimated in this cohort because persons with PASC may have been more motivated to enroll. The study did not capture PASC that resolved before enrollment. CONCLUSION A high burden of persistent symptoms was observed in persons after COVID-19. Extensive diagnostic evaluation revealed no specific cause of reported symptoms in most cases. Antibody levels were highly variable after COVID-19.

N.; Chew, J.; Lim, J. P.; Yew, S.; Yeo, A.; Lim, W. S. [JOURNAL]: J Frailty Aging [ABSTRACT]: BACKGROUND: Despite emerging evidence about the association between social frailty and cognitive impairment, little is known about the role of executive function in this interplay, and whether the coexistence of social frailty and cognitive impairment predisposes to adverse health outcomes in healthy community-dwelling older adults. OBJECTIVES: We aim to examine independent associations between social frailty with the MMSE and FAB, and to determine if having both social frailty and cognitive impairment is associated with worse health outcomes than either or neither condition. METHODS: We studied 229 cognitively intact and functionally independent community-dwelling older adults (mean age= 67.2±7.43). Outcome measures comprise physical activity; physical performance and frailty; geriatric syndromes; life space and quality of life. We compared Chinese Mini Mental State Examination (CMMSE) and Chinese Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) scores across the socially non-frail, socially pre-frail and socially frail. Participants were further recategorized into three subgroups (neither, either or both) based on presence of social frailty and cognitive impairment. Cognitive impairment was defined as a score below the educational adjusted cut-offs in either CMMSE or FAB. We performed logistic regression adjusted for significant covariates and mood to examine association with outcomes across the three subgroups. RESULTS: Compared with CMMSE, Chinese FAB scores significantly decreased across the social frailty spectrum (p<0.001), suggesting strong association between executive function with social frailty. We derived three subgroups relative to relationship with socially frailty and executive dysfunction: (i) Neither, N=140(61.1%), (ii) Either, N=79(34.5%), and (iii) Both, N=10(4.4%). Compared with neither or either subgroups, having both social frailty and executive dysfunction was associated with anorexia (OR=4.79, 95% CI= 1.04–22.02), near falls and falls (OR= 5.23, 95% CI= 1.10–24.90), lower life-space mobility (odds ratio, OR=9.80, 95% CI=2.07–46.31) and poorer quality of life (OR= 13.2, 95% CI= 2.38–73.4). CONCLUSION: Our results explicated the association of executive dysfunction with social frailty, and their synergistic relationship independent of mood with geriatric syndromes, decreased life space and poorer quality of life. In light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, the association between social frailty and executive dysfunction merits further study as a possible target for early intervention in relatively healthy older adults.', '[TITLE]: Cancer as a prospective sequela of long COVID‐19 [AUTHORS]: Saini, Geetanjali; Aneja, Ritu [JOURNAL]: Bioessays [ABSTRACT]: As the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) continues to surge worldwide, our knowledge of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is rapidly expanding. Although most COVID‐19 patients recover within weeks of symptom onset, some experience lingering symptoms that last for months (“long COVID‐19”). Early reports of COVID‐19 sequelae, including cardiovascular, pulmonary, and neurological conditions, have raised concerns about the long‐term effects of COVID‐19, especially in hard‐hit communities. It is becoming increasingly evident that cancer patients are more susceptible to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and are at a higher risk of severe COVID‐19 than the general population. Nevertheless, whether long COVID‐19 increases the risk of cancer in those with no prior malignancies, remains unclear. Given, the disproportionate impact of the disease on the African American community, yet another unanswered question is whether racial disparities are to be expected in COVID‐19 sequelae. Herein, we propose that long COVID‐19 may predispose recovered patients to cancer development and accelerate cancer progression. This hypothesis is based on growing evidence of the ability of SARS‐CoV‐2 to modulate oncogenic pathways, promote chronic low‐grade inflammation, and cause tissue damage. Comprehensive studies are urgently required to elucidate the effects of long COVID‐19 on cancer susceptibility.', '[TITLE]: Possible Sarcopenia and Impact of Dual-Task Exercise on Gait Speed, Handgrip Strength, Falls, and Perceived Health [AUTHORS]: Merchant, Reshma Aziz; Chan, Yiong Huak; Hui, Richard Jor Yeong; Lim, Jia Yi; Kwek, Sing Cheer; Seetharaman, Santhosh K.; Au, Lydia Shu Yi; Morley, John E. [JOURNAL]: Front Med (Lausanne) [ABSTRACT]: Background: Sarcopenia is defined as a progressive age-related loss in muscle mass and strength affecting physical performance. It is associated with many negative outcomes including falls, disability, cognitive decline, and mortality. Protein enriched diet and resistance training have shown to improve muscle strength and function but there is limited evidence on impact of dual-task exercise in possible sarcopenia. Objective: To evaluate impact of community-based dual-task exercise on muscle strength and physical function in possible sarcopenia defined by either slow gait (SG) or poor handgrip strength (HGS). The secondary aims include effect on cognition, frailty, falls, social isolation, and perceived health. Methods: Community-dwelling older adults ≥60 years old were recruited from screening program intended to identify seniors at risk, and invited to participate in dual-task exercise program called HAPPY (Healthy Aging Promotion Program for You). One hundred and eleven participants with possible sarcopenia completed 3 months follow-up. Questionnaire was administered on demographics, frailty, sarcopenia, falls, perceived health, social network, functional, and cognitive status. Physical performance included assessment of HGS, gait speed, and Short Physical Performance Battery test (SPPB). Results: The mean age of the Exercise group was 75.9 years old and 73.0% were women. The Exercise group had more female (73.0 vs. 47.5%), were older (75.9 vs. 72.5 years old), had higher prevalence of falls (32.4 vs. 15.0%), lower BMI (23.7 vs. 25.8), and education (4.0 vs. 7.2 years). The gait speed of the Exercise group increased significantly with significant reduction in the prevalence of SG and poor HGS. All components of SPPB as well as the total score increased significantly while the prevalence of pre-frailty and falls dropped by half. The risk of social isolation reduced by 25% with significant improvement in perceived health and cognition in the Exercise group. Significant impact on improvement gait speed and SPPB persisted after adjustment for baseline factors. Conclusion: Dual-task exercise program is effective in improving gait speed, SPPB score, and reducing the prevalence of poor HGS with significant improvement in perceived health, cognition, and reduction in falls and frailty. Future prospective randomized control trials are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of dual-task interventions in reversing sarcopenia.', '[TITLE]: Severity of respiratory failure and computed chest tomography in acute COVID-19 correlates with pulmonary function and respiratory symptoms after infection with SARS-CoV-2: an observational longitudinal study over 12 months [AUTHORS]: Steinbeis, F.; Thibeault, C.; Doellinger, F.; Ring, R.

E.; Kurth, F.; Penzkofer, T.; Witzenrath, M.; Zoller, T. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Background Prospective and longitudinal data on pulmonary injury over one year after acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are sparse. Research question: With this study, we aim to investigate pulmonary outcome following SARS-CoV-2 infection including pulmonary function, computed chest tomography, respiratory symptoms and quality of life over 12 months. Study design and Methods 180 patients after acute COVID-19 were enrolled into a single-centre, prospective observational study and examined 6 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months after onset of COVID-19 symptoms. Chest CT-scans, pulmonary function and symptoms assessed by St. Georges Respiratory Questionnaire were used to evaluate objective and subjective respiratory limitations. Patients were stratified according to acute COVID-19 disease severity. Results Of 180 patients enrolled, 42/180 were not hospitalized during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, 29/180 were hospitalized without need for oxygen, 43/180 with need for low-flow and 24/180 with high-flow oxygen, 26/180 required invasive mechanical ventilation and 16/180 were treated with ECMO. After acute COVID-19, pulmonary restriction and reduced carbon monoxide diffusion capacity was associated with disease severity after the acute phase and improved over 12 months except for those requiring ECMO treatment. Patients with milder disease showed a predominant reduction of ventilated area instead of simple restriction. The CT score of lung involvement in the acute phase increased significantly with COVID-19 severity and was associated with restriction and reduction in diffusion capacity in follow-up. Respiratory symptoms improved for patients in higher severity groups during follow-up, but not for patients with mild initially disease. Interpretation Severity of respiratory failure during COVID-19 correlates with the degree of pulmonary function impairment and respiratory quality of life in the year after acute infection. Patients with mild vs. severe disease show different patterns of lung involvement and symptom resolution.', '[TITLE]: Long COVID: post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 with a cardiovascular focus [AUTHORS]: Raman, Betty; Bluemke, David A.; Lüscher, Thomas F.; Neubauer, Stefan [JOURNAL]: Eur Heart J [ABSTRACT]: Emerging as a new epidemic, long COVID or post-acute sequelae of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a condition characterized by the persistence of COVID-19 symptoms beyond 3 months, is anticipated to substantially alter the lives of millions of people globally. Cardiopulmonary symptoms including chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, and autonomic manifestations such as postural orthostatic tachycardia are common and associated with significant disability, heightened anxiety, and public awareness. A range of cardiovascular (CV) abnormalities has been reported among patients beyond the acute phase and include myocardial inflammation, myocardial infarction, right ventricular dysfunction, and arrhythmias. Pathophysiological mechanisms for delayed complications are still poorly understood, with a dissociation seen between ongoing symptoms and objective measures of cardiopulmonary health. COVID-19 is anticipated to alter the long-term trajectory of many chronic cardiac diseases which are abundant in those at risk of severe disease. In this review, we discuss the definition of long COVID and its epidemiology, with an emphasis on cardiopulmonary symptoms. We further review the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying acute and chronic CV injury, the range of post-acute CV sequelae, and impact of COVID-19 on multiorgan health. We propose a possible model for referral of post-COVID-19 patients to cardiac services and discuss future directions including research priorities and clinical trials that are currently underway to evaluate the efficacy of treatment strategies for long COVID and associated CV sequelae.', '[TITLE]: Breakthrough Symptomatic COVID-19 Infections Leading to Long Covid: Report from Long Covid Facebook Group Poll [AUTHORS]: Massey, D.; Berrent, D.; Krumholz, H. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Vaccines have been shown to be extremely effective in preventing COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths. However, a question remains whether vaccine breakthrough cases can still lead to Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC), also known as Long Covid. To address this question, the Survivor Corps group, a grassroots COVID-19 organization focused on patient support and research, posted a poll to its 169,900 members that asked about breakthrough cases, Long Covid, and hospitalizations. 1,949 people who self-report being fully vaccinated have responded to date. While robust data are needed in a larger, unbiased sample to extrapolate rates to the population, we analyzed the results of this public poll to determine what people were reporting regarding Long Covid after breakthrough infection and to prompt discussion of how breakthrough cases are measured. The poll was posted in the Survivor Corps Facebook group (~169,900 members). Of the 1,949 participants who responded to the poll, 44 reported a symptomatic breakthrough case and 24 of those reported that the case led to symptoms of Long Covid. 1 of these 24 cases was reported to have led to hospitalization in addition to Long Covid.', '[TITLE]: Pre-pandemic Cognitive Function and COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy: Cohort Study [AUTHORS]: David Batty, G.; Deary, Ian J.; Fawns-Ritchie, Chloe; Gale, Catharine R.; Altschul, Drew [JOURNAL]: Brain Behav Immun [ABSTRACT]: BACKGROUND: Whereas several predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy have been examined, the role of cognitive function following the widely publicised development of an inoculation is unknown. Accordingly, our objective was to test the association between scores from an array of cognitive function tests and self-reported vaccine hesitancy after the announcement of the successful testing of the Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine. METHODS: We used individual-level data from a pandemic-focused study (COVID Survey), a prospective cohort study nested within United Kingdom Understanding Society (Main Survey). In the week immediately following the announcement of successful testing of the first efficacious inoculation (November/December 2020), data on vaccine intentionality were collected in 11740 individuals (6702 women) aged 16-95. Pre-pandemic scores on general cognitive function, ascertained from a battery of six tests, were captured in 2011/12 wave of the Main Survey. Study members self-reported their intention to take up a vaccination for COVID-19. RESULTS: Of the study sample, 17.2% (N=1842) indicated they were hesitant about having the vaccine. After adjustment for age, sex, and ethnicity, study members with a lower baseline cognition score were markedly more likely to be vaccine hesitant (odds ratio per standard deviation lower score in cognition; 95% confidence interval: 1.76; 1.62, 1.90). Adjustment for mental and physical health plus household shielding status had no impact on these results, whereas controlling for educational attainment led to partial attenuation but the probability of hesitancy was still elevated (1.52; 1.37, 1.67). There was a linear association for vaccine hesitancy across the full range of cognition scores (p for trend: p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Erroneous social media reports might have complicated personal decision-making, leading to people with lower cognitive ability test scores being vaccine-hesitant. With people with lower cognition also experiencing higher rates of COVID-19 in studies conducted prior to vaccine distribution, these new findings are suggestive of a potential additional disease burden.', '[TITLE]: Clinical Characteristics, Activity Levels and Mental Health Problems in Children with Long COVID: A Survey of 510 Children [AUTHORS]: Buonsenso, Danilo Espuny Pujol Ferran Munblit Daniel McFarland Sammie Simpson Frances [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Background: The World Health Organization has recently recognized Long COVID, calling the international medical community to strengthen research and comprehensive care of patients with this condition. However, if Long COVID pertains to children as well is not yet clear. Methods An anonymous, online survey was developed by an organization of parents of children suffering from persisting symptoms since initial infection. Parents were asked to report signs and symptoms, physical activity and mental health issues. Only children with symptoms persisting for more than four weeks were included. Results 510 children were included (56.3% females) infected between January 2020 and January 2021. At their initial COVID-19 infection, 22 (4.3%) children were hospitalized. Overall, children had persisting COVID-19 for a mean of 8.2 months (SD 3.9). Most frequent symptoms were: Tiredness and weakness (444 patients, 87.1% of sample), Fatigue (410, 80.4%), Headache (401, 78.6%), Abdominal pain (387, 75.9%), Muscle and joint pain (309, 60.6%), Post-exertional malaise (274, 53.7%), rash (267, 52.4%). 484 (94.9%) children had had at least four symptoms. 129 (25.3%) children have suffered constant COVID-19 infection symptoms, 252 (49.4%) have had periods of apparent recovery and then symptoms returning, and 97 (19.0%) had a prolonged period of wellness followed by symptoms. Only 51 (10.0%) children have returned to previous levels of physical activity. Parents reported a significant prevalence of Neuropsychiatric symptoms. Conclusions Our study provides further evidence on Long COVID in children. Symptoms like fatigue, headache, muscle and joint pain, rashes and heart palpitations, and mental health issues like lack of concentration and short memory problems, were particularly frequent and confirm previous observations, suggesting that they may characterize this condition. A better comprehension of Long COVID is urgently needed..']}\n"

[AUTHORS]: Crook, Harry; Raza, Sanara; Nowell, Joseph; Young, Megan; Edison, Paul [JOURNAL]: BMJ [ABSTRACT]: Since its emergence in Wuhan, China, covid-19 has spread and had a profound effect on the lives and health of people around the globe. As of 4 July 2021, more than 183 million confirmed cases of covid-19 had been recorded worldwide, and 3.97 million deaths. Recent evidence has shown that a range of persistent symptoms can remain long after the acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, and this condition is now coined long covid by recognized research institutes. Studies have shown that long covid can affect the whole spectrum of people with covid-19, from those with very mild acute disease to the most severe forms. Like acute covid-19, long covid can involve multiple organs and can affect many systems including, but not limited to, the respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, gastrointestinal, and musculoskeletal systems. The symptoms of long covid include fatigue, dyspnea, cardiac abnormalities, cognitive impairment, sleep disturbances, symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, muscle pain, concentration problems, and headache. This review summarizes studies of the long term effects of covid-19 in hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients and describes the persistent symptoms they endure. Risk factors for acute covid-19 and long covid and possible therapeutic options are also discussed.', '[TITLE]: Clinical characteristics with inflammation profiling of long COVID and association with 1-year recovery following hospitalisation in the UK: a prospective observational study [AUTHORS]:  [JOURNAL]: Lancet Respir Med [ABSTRACT]: BACKGROUND: No effective pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions exist for patients with long COVID. We aimed to describe recovery 1 year after hospital discharge for COVID-19, identify factors associated with patient-perceived recovery, and identify potential therapeutic targets by describing the underlying inflammatory profiles of the previously described recovery clusters at 5 months after hospital discharge. METHODS: The Post-hospitalisation COVID-19 study (PHOSP-COVID) is a prospective, longitudinal cohort study recruiting adults (aged ≥18 years) discharged from hospital with COVID-19 across the UK. Recovery was assessed using patient-reported outcome measures, physical performance, and organ function at 5 months and 1 year after hospital discharge, and stratified by both patient-perceived recovery and recovery cluster. Hierarchical logistic regression modelling was performed for patient-perceived recovery at 1 year. Cluster analysis was done using the clustering large applications k-medoids approach using clinical outcomes at 5 months. Inflammatory protein profiling was analysed from plasma at the 5-month visit. This study is registered on the ISRCTN Registry, ISRCTN10980107, and recruitment is ongoing. FINDINGS: 2320 participants discharged from hospital between March 7, 2020, and April 18, 2021, were assessed at 5 months after discharge and 807 (32·7%) participants completed both the 5-month and 1-year visits. 279 (35·6%) of these 807 patients were women and 505 (64·4%) were men, with a mean age of 58·7 (SD 12·5) years, and 224 (27·8%) had received invasive mechanical ventilation (WHO class 7–9). The proportion of patients reporting full recovery was unchanged between 5 months (501 [25·5%] of 1965) and 1 year (232 [28·9%] of 804). Factors associated with being less likely to report full recovery at 1 year were female sex (odds ratio 0·68 [95% CI 0·46–0·99]), obesity (0·50 [0·34–0·74]) and invasive mechanical ventilation (0·42 [0·23–0·76]). Cluster analysis (n=1636) corroborated the previously reported four clusters: very severe, severe, moderate with cognitive impairment, and mild, relating to the severity of physical health, mental health, and cognitive impairment at 5 months. We found increased inflammatory mediators of tissue damage and repair in both the very severe and the moderate with cognitive impairment clusters compared with the mild cluster, including IL-6 concentration, which was increased in both comparisons (n=626 participants). We found a substantial deficit in median EQ-5D-5L utility index from before COVID-19 (retrospective assessment; 0·88 [IQR 0·74–1·00]), at 5 months (0·74 [0·64–0·88]) to 1 year (0·75 [0·62–0·88]), with minimal improvements across all outcome measures at 1 year after discharge in the whole cohort and within each of the four clusters. INTERPRETATION: The sequelae of a hospital admission with COVID-19 were substantial 1 year after discharge across a range of health domains, with the minority in our cohort feeling fully recovered. Patient-perceived health-related quality of life was reduced at 1 year compared with before hospital admission. Systematic inflammation and obesity are potential treatable traits that warrant further investigation in clinical trials.

[JOURNAL]: Brain Behav Immun [ABSTRACT]: Importance COVID-19 is associated with clinically significant symptoms despite resolution of the acute infection (i.e., post-COVID-19 syndrome). Fatigue and cognitive impairment are amongst the most common and debilitating symptoms of post-COVID-19 syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To quantify the proportion of individuals experiencing fatigue and cognitive impairment 12 or more weeks following COVID-19 diagnosis, and to characterize the inflammatory correlates and functional consequences of post-COVID-19 syndrome. DATA SOURCES: Systematic searches were conducted without language restrictions from database inception to June 8, 2021 on PubMed/MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, PsycInfo, Embase, Web of Science, Google/Google Scholar, and select reference lists. STUDY SELECTION: Primary research articles which evaluated individuals at least 12 weeks after confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis and specifically reported on fatigue, cognitive impairment, inflammatory parameters, and/or functional outcomes were selected. DATA EXTRACTION & SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers independently extracted published summary data and assessed methodological quality and risk of bias. A meta-analysis of proportions was conducted to pool Freeman-Turkey double arcsine transformed proportions using the random-effects restricted maximum-likelihood model. MAIN OUTCOMES & MEASURES: The co-primary outcomes were the proportions of individuals reporting fatigue and cognitive impairment, respectively, 12 or more weeks after COVID-19 infection. The secondary outcomes were inflammatory correlates and functional consequences of post-COVID-19 syndrome. RESULTS: The literature search yielded 10,979 studies, and 81 studies were selected for inclusion. The fatigue meta-analysis comprised 68 studies, the cognitive impairment meta-analysis comprised 43 studies, and 48 studies were included in the narrative synthesis. Meta-analysis revealed that the proportion of individuals experiencing fatigue 12 or more weeks following COVID-19 diagnosis was 0.32 (95% CI, 0.27, 0.37; p < 0.001; n = 25,268; I(2)=99.1%). The proportion of individuals exhibiting cognitive impairment was 0.22 (95% CI, 0.17, 0.28; p < 0.001; n = 13,232; I(2)=98.0). Moreover, narrative synthesis revealed elevations in proinflammatory markers and considerable functional impairment in a subset of individuals. CONCLUSIONS & RELEVANCE: A significant proportion of individuals experience persistent fatigue and/or cognitive impairment following resolution of acute COVID-19. The frequency and debilitating nature of the foregoing symptoms provides the impetus to characterize the underlying neurobiological substrates and how to best treat these phenomena.

D.; Malinovschi, A.; Mao, W.; Mazankova, L.; McCulloch, D.; Menges, D [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Importance: While much of the attention on the COVID-19 pandemic was directed at the daily counts of cases and those with serious disease overwhelming health services, increasingly, reports have appeared of people who experience debilitating symptoms after the initial infection. This is popularly known as long COVID. Objective: To estimate by country and territory of the number of patients affected by long COVID in 2020 and 2021, the severity of their symptoms and expected pattern of recovery Design: We jointly analyzed ten ongoing cohort studies in ten countries for the occurrence of three major symptom clusters of long COVID among representative COVID cases. The defining symptoms of the three clusters (fatigue, cognitive problems, and shortness of breath) are explicitly mentioned in the WHO clinical case definition. For incidence of long COVID, we adopted the minimum duration after infection of three months from the WHO case definition. We pooled data from the contributing studies, two large medical record databases in the United States, and findings from 44 published studies using a Bayesian meta-regression tool. We separately estimated occurrence and pattern of recovery in patients with milder acute infections and those hospitalized. We estimated the incidence and prevalence of long COVID globally and by country in 2020 and 2021 as well as the severity-weighted prevalence using disability weights from the Global Burden of Disease study. Results: Analyses are based on detailed information for 1906 community infections and 10526 hospitalized patients from the ten collaborating cohorts, three of which included children. We added published data on 37262 community infections and 9540 hospitalized patients as well as ICD-coded medical record data concerning 1.3 million infections. Globally, in 2020 and 2021, 144.7 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 54.8-312.9) people suffered from any of the three symptom clusters of long COVID. This corresponds to 3.69% (1.38-7.96) of all infections. The fatigue, respiratory, and cognitive clusters occurred in 51.0% (16.9-92.4), 60.4% (18.9-89.1), and 35.4% (9.4-75.1) of long COVID cases, respectively. Those with milder acute COVID-19 cases had a quicker estimated recovery (median duration 3.99 months [IQR 3.84-4.20]) than those admitted for the acute infection (median duration 8.84 months [IQR 8.10-9.78]). At twelve months, 15.1% (10.3-21.1) continued to experience long COVID symptoms. Conclusions and relevance: The occurrence of debilitating ongoing symptoms of COVID-19 is common. Knowing how many people are affected, and for how long, is important to plan for rehabilitative services and support to return to social activities, places of learning, and the workplace when symptoms start to wane.', '[TITLE]: Does pre-infection stress increase the risk of long COVID? Longitudinal associations between adversity worries and experiences in the month prior to COVID-19 infection and the development of long COVID and specific long COVID symptoms [AUTHORS]: Paul, E.; Fancourt, D. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Background Long COVID is increasingly recognised as public health burden. Demographic and infection-related characteristics have been identified as risk factors, but less research has focused on psychosocial predictors such as stress immediately preceding the index infection. Research on whether stressors predict the development of specific long COVID symptoms is also lacking. Methods Data from 1,966 UK adults who had previously been infected with COVID-19 and who took part in the UCL COVID-19 Social Study were analysed. The number of adversity experiences (e.g., job loss) and the number of worries about adversity experiences within the month prior to COVID-19 infection were used to predict the development of self-reported long COVID and the presence of three specific long COVID symptoms (difficulty with mobility, cognition, and self-care). The interaction between a three-level index of socio-economic position (SEP; with higher values indicating lower SEP) and the exposure variables in relation to long COVID status was also examined. Analyses controlled for a range of COVID-19 infection characteristics, socio-demographics, and health-related factors. Findings Odds of self-reported long COVID increased by 1.25 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04 to 1.51) for each additional worry about adversity in the month prior to COVID-19 infection. Although there was no evidence for an interaction between SEP and either exposure variable, individuals in the lowest SEP group were nearly twice as likely to have developed long COVID as those in the highest SEP group (OR: 1.95; 95% CI: 1.19 to 3.19) and worries about adversity experiences remained a predictor of long COVID (OR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.98). The number of worries about adversity experiences also corresponded with increased odds of certain long COVID symptoms such as difficulty with cognition (e.g., difficulty remembering or concentrating) by 1.46 (95% CI: 1.02 to 2.09) but not with mobility (e.g., walking or climbing steps) or self-care (e.g., washing all over or dressing). Interpretation Results suggest a key role of stress in the time preceding the acute COVID-19 infection for the development of long COVID and for difficulty with cognition specifically. These findings point to the importance of mitigating worries and experiences of adversities during pandemics both to reduce their psychological impact but also help reduce the societal burden of longer-term illness.', \"[TITLE]: Characterizing long COVID in an international cohort: 7 months of symptoms and their impact [AUTHORS]: Davis, Hannah E.; Assaf, Gina S.; McCorkell, Lisa; Wei, Hannah; Low, Ryan J.; Re'em, Yochai; Redfield, Signe; Austin, Jared P.; Akrami, Athena [JOURNAL]: EClinicalMedicine [ABSTRACT]: BACKGROUND: A significant number of patients with COVID-19 experience prolonged symptoms, known as Long COVID. Few systematic studies have investigated this population, particularly in outpatient settings. Hence, relatively little is known about symptom makeup and severity, expected clinical course, impact on daily functioning, and return to baseline health. METHODS: We conducted an online survey of people with suspected and confirmed COVID-19, distributed via COVID-19 support groups (e.g. Body Politic, Long COVID Support Group, Long Haul COVID Fighters) and social media (e.g. Twitter, Facebook). Data were collected from September 6, 2020 to November 25, 2020. We analyzed responses from 3762 participants with confirmed (diagnostic/antibody positive; 1020) or suspected (diagnostic/antibody negative or untested; 2742) COVID-19, from 56 countries, with illness lasting over 28 days and onset prior to June 2020. We estimated the prevalence of 203 symptoms in 10 organ systems and traced 66 symptoms over seven months. We measured the impact on life, work, and return to baseline health. FINDINGS: For the majority of respondents (>91%), the time to recovery exceeded 35 weeks. During their illness, participants experienced an average of 55.9+/- 25.5 (mean+/-STD) symptoms, across an average of 9.1 organ systems. The most frequent symptoms after month 6 were fatigue, post-exertional malaise, and cognitive dysfunction. Symptoms varied in their prevalence over time, and we identified three symptom clusters, each with a characteristic temporal profile. 85.9% of participants (95% CI, 84.8% to 87.0%) experienced relapses, primarily triggered by exercise, physical or mental activity, and stress. 86.7% (85.6% to 92.5%) of unrecovered respondents were experiencing fatigue at the time of survey, compared to 44.7% (38.5% to 50.5%) of recovered respondents. 1700 respondents (45.2%) required a reduced work schedule compared to pre-illness, and an additional 839 (22.3%) were not working at the time of survey due to illness. Cognitive dysfunction or memory issues were common across all age groups (~88%). Except for loss of smell and taste, the prevalence and trajectory of all symptoms were similar between groups with confirmed and suspected COVID-19. INTERPRETATION: Patients with Long COVID report prolonged, multisystem involvement and significant disability. By seven months, many patients have not yet recovered (mainly from systemic and neurological/cognitive symptoms), have not returned to previous levels of work, and continue to experience significant symptom burden.

However, there is little information regarding the nature and broader prevalence of cognitive problems post-infection or across the full spread of disease severity. METHODS: We sought to confirm whether there was an association between cross-sectional cognitive performance data from 81,337 participants who between January and December 2020 undertook a clinically validated web-optimized assessment as part of the Great British Intelligence Test, and questionnaire items capturing self-report of suspected and confirmed COVID-19 infection and respiratory symptoms. FINDINGS: People who had recovered from COVID-19, including those no longer reporting symptoms, exhibited significant cognitive deficits versus controls when controlling for age, gender, education level, income, racial-ethnic group, pre-existing medical disorders, tiredness, depression and anxiety. The deficits were of substantial effect size for people who had been hospitalised (N = 192), but also for non-hospitalised cases who had biological confirmation of COVID-19 infection (N = 326). Analysing markers of premorbid intelligence did not support these differences being present prior to infection. Finer grained analysis of performance across sub-tests supported the hypothesis that COVID-19 has a multi-domain impact on human cognition. INTERPRETATION: Interpretation. These results accord with reports of ‘Long Covid’ cognitive symptoms that persist into the early-chronic phase. They should act as a clarion call for further research with longitudinal and neuroimaging cohorts to plot recovery trajectories and identify the biological basis of cognitive deficits in SARS-COV-2 survivors.

[JOURNAL]: Front Aging Neurosci [ABSTRACT]: COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been often characterized as a respiratory disease. However, it is increasingly being understood as an infection that impacts multiple systems, and many patients report neurological symptoms. Indeed, there is accumulating evidence for neural damage in some individuals, with recent studies suggesting loss of gray matter in multiple regions, particularly in the left hemisphere. There are several mechanisms by which the COVID-19 infection may lead to neurological symptoms and structural and functional changes in the brain, and cognitive problems are one of the most commonly reported symptoms in those experiencing Long COVID – the chronic illness following the COVID-19 infection that affects between 10 and 25% of patients. However, there is yet little research testing cognition in Long COVID. The COVID and Cognition Study is a cross-sectional/longitudinal study aiming to understand cognitive problems in Long COVID. The first paper from the study explored the characteristics of our sample of 181 individuals who had experienced the COVID-19 infection, and 185 who had not, and the factors that predicted ongoing symptoms and self-reported cognitive deficits. In this second paper from the study, we assess this sample on tests of memory, language, and executive function. We hypothesize that performance on “objective” cognitive tests will reflect self-reported cognitive symptoms. We further hypothesize that some symptom profiles may be more predictive of cognitive performance than others, perhaps giving some information about the mechanism. We found a consistent pattern of memory deficits in those that had experienced the COVID-19 infection, with deficits increasing with the severity of self-reported ongoing symptoms. Fatigue/Mixed symptoms during the initial illness and ongoing neurological symptoms were predictive of cognitive performance.', '[TITLE]: Health outcomes in people 2 years after surviving hospitalisation with COVID-19: a longitudinal cohort study [AUTHORS]: Huang, Lixue; Li, Xia; Gu, Xiaoying; Zhang, Hui; Ren, LiLi; Guo, Li; Liu, Min; Wang, Yimin; Cui, Dan; Wang, Yeming; Zhang, Xueyang; Shang, Lianhan; Zhong, Jingchuan; Wang, Xinming; Wang, Jianwei; Cao, Bin [JOURNAL]: Lancet Respir Med [ABSTRACT]: BACKGROUND: With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, growing evidence shows that a considerable proportion of people who have recovered from COVID-19 have long-term effects on multiple organs and systems. A few longitudinal studies have reported on the persistent health effects of COVID-19, but the follow-up was limited to 1 year after acute infection. The aim of our study was to characterise the longitudinal evolution of health outcomes in hospital survivors with different initial disease severity throughout 2 years after acute COVID-19 infection and to determine their recovery status. METHODS: We did an ambidirectional, longitudinal cohort study of individuals who had survived hospitalisation with COVID-19 and who had been discharged from Jin Yin-tan Hospital (Wuhan, China) between Jan 7 and May 29, 2020. We measured health outcomes 6 months (June 16–Sept 3, 2020), 12 months (Dec 16, 2020–Feb 7, 2021), and 2 years (Nov 16, 2021–Jan 10, 2022) after symptom onset with a 6-min walking distance (6MWD) test, laboratory tests, and a series of questionnaires on symptoms, mental health, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), return to work, and health-care use after discharge. A subset of COVID-19 survivors received pulmonary function tests and chest imaging at each visit. Age-matched, sex-matched, and comorbidities-matched participants without COVID-19 infection (controls) were introduced to determine the recovery status of COVID-19 survivors at 2 years. The primary outcomes included symptoms, modified British Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnoea scale, HRQoL, 6MWD, and return to work, and were assessed in all COVID-19 survivors who attended all three follow-up visits. Symptoms, mMRC dyspnoea scale, and HRQoL were also assessed in controls. FINDINGS: 2469 patients with COVID-19 were discharged from Jin Yin-tan Hospital between Jan 7 and May 29, 2020. 1192 COVID-19 survivors completed assessments at the three follow-up visits and were included in the final analysis, 1119 (94%) of whom attended the face-to-face interview 2 years after infection. The median age at discharge was 57·0 years (48·0–65·0) and 551 (46%) were women. The median follow-up time after symptom onset was 185·0 days (IQR 175·0–197·0) for the visit at 6 months, 349·0 days (337·0–360·0) for the visit at 12 months, and 685·0 days (675·0–698·0) for the visit at 2 years. The proportion of COVID-19 survivors with at least one sequelae symptom decreased significantly from 777 (68%) of 1149 at 6 months to 650 (55%) of 1190 at 2 years (p<0·0001), with fatigue or muscle weakness always being the most frequent. The proportion of COVID-19 survivors with an mMRC score of at least 1 was 168 (14%) of 1191 at 2 years, significantly lower than the 288 (26%) of 1104 at 6 months (p<0·0001). HRQoL continued to improve in almost all domains, especially in terms of anxiety or depression: the proportion of individuals with symptoms of anxiety or depression decreased from 256 (23%) of 1105 at 6 months to 143 (12%) 1191 at 2 years (p<0·0001). The proportion of individuals with a 6MWD less than the lower limit of the normal range declined continuously in COVID-19 survivors overall and in the three subgroups of varying initial disease severity. 438 (89%) of 494 COVID-19 survivors had returned to their original work at 2 years. Survivors with long COVID symptoms at 2 years had lower HRQoL, worse exercise capacity, more mental health abnormality, and increased health-care use after discharge than survivors without long COVID symptoms. COVID-19 survivors still had more prevalent symptoms and more problems in pain or discomfort, as well as anxiety or depression, at 2 years than did controls. Additionally, a significantly higher proportion of survivors who had received higher-level respiratory support during hospitalisation had lung diffusion impairment (43 [65%] of 66 vs 24 [36%] of 66, p=0·0009), reduced residual volume (41 [62%] vs 13 [20%], p<0·0001), and total lung capacity (26 [39%] vs four [6%], p<0·0001) than did controls. INTERPRETATION: Regardless of initial disease severity, COVID-19 survivors had longitudinal improvements in physical and mental health, with most returning to their original work within 2 years; however, the burden of symptomatic sequelae remained fairly high. COVID-19 survivors had a remarkably lower health status than the general population at 2 years. The study findings indicate that there is an urgent need to explore the pathogenesis of long COVID and develop effective interventions to reduce the risk of long COVID.', '[TITLE]: Cognitive decline and brainstem hypometabolism in long COVID: A case series [AUTHORS]: Hugon, Jacques; Queneau, Mathieu; Sanchez Ortiz, Marta; Msika, Eva Flore; Farid, Karim; Paquet, Claire [JOURNAL]: Brain Behav [ABSTRACT]: OBJECTIVE: To assess FDG cerebral PET in patients suffering from cognitive impairment linked to Long COVID. The COVID pandemic has affected dozens of millions of people around the world and has resulted in the deaths of more than 3 million people. Following the acute forms, it has been reported sometimes long forms of COVID, with involvements of several organs including the brain. Neurological complications can include cognitive disturbances (brain fog) that are very common and can seriously disturb the life of patients. METHODS: Fluorodeoxyglucose PETs were performed in 3 patients with cognitive decline following COVID infection. RESULTS: We report here 3 cases of brain fog with major hypometabolic areas of the pons revealed by the cerebral FDG PET. CONCLUSION: The dysfunction of the locus coeruleus in these patients could partly explain the cognitive disorders observed. Further studies involving larger cohorts of patients suffering from cognitive dysfunction will be needed to determine if the brainstem is frequently affected in these patients.', '[TITLE]: Multi-organ impairment and Long COVID: a 1-year prospective, longitudinal cohort study [AUTHORS]: Dennis, A.; Cuthbertson, D.

J.; Banerjee, R.; Banerjee, A. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Importance: Multi-organ impairment associated with Long COVID is a significant burden to individuals, populations and health systems, presenting challenges for diagnosis and care provision. Standardised assessment across multiple organs over time is lacking, particularly in non-hospitalised individuals. Objective: To determine the prevalence of organ impairment in Long COVID patients at 6 and at 12 months after initial symptoms and to explore links to clinical presentation. Design: This was a prospective, longitudinal study in individuals following recovery from acute COVID-19. We assessed symptoms, health status, and multi-organ tissue characterisation and function, using consensus definitions for single and multi-organ impairment. Physiological and biochemical investigations were performed at baseline on all individuals and those with organ impairment were reassessed, including multi-organ MRI, 6 months later. Setting: Two non-acute settings (Oxford and London). Participants: 536 individuals (mean 45 years, 73% female, 89% white, 32% healthcare workers, 13% acute COVID-19 hospitalisation) completed baseline assessment (median: 6 months post-COVID-19). 331 (62%) with organ impairment or incidental findings had follow up, with reduced symptom burden from baseline (median number of symptoms: 10 and 3, at 6 and 12 months). Exposure: SARS-CoV-2 infection 6 months prior to first assessment. Main outcome: Prevalence of single and multi-organ impairment at 6 and 12 months post-COVID-19. Results: Extreme breathlessness (36% and 30%), cognitive dysfunction (50% and 38%) and poor health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L<0.7; 55% and 45%) were common at 6 and 12 months, and associated with female gender, younger age and single organ impairment. At baseline, there was fibro-inflammation in the heart (9%), pancreas (9%), kidney (15%) and liver (11%); increased volume in liver (7%), spleen (8%) and kidney (9%); decreased capacity in lungs (2%); and excessive fat deposition in the liver (25%) and pancreas (15%). Single and multi-organ impairment were present in 59% and 23% at baseline, persisting in 59% and 27% at follow-up. Conclusion and Relevance: Organ impairment was present in 59% of individuals at 6 months post-COVID-19, persisting in 59% of those followed up at 1 year, with implications for symptoms, quality of life and longer-term health, signalling need for prevention and integrated care of Long COVID.

We conducted a self-administered questionnaire survey on sequelae, psychological distress (K6), impairments in work performance (WFun), and COVID-19–related experiences of stigma and discrimination in two designated COVID-19 hospitals in Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan, between August 2020 and March 2021. The prevalence of sequelae was calculated by age and COVID-19 severity. Factors independently associated with sequelae or psychological distress were identified using logistic regression analysis. Among 127 patients who had recovered from COVID-19, 52.0% had persistent symptoms at a median of 29 days [IQR 23–128] after COVID-19 onset. Among patients with mild COVID-19, 49.5% had sequelae. The most frequent symptoms were olfactory disorders (15.0%), taste disorders (14.2%), and cough (14.2%). Multivariate analysis showed that age was an independent risk factor for sequelae (adjusted odds ratios [AOR] for ≥ 60 years vs. < 40 years 3.63, p = 0.0165). Possible psychological distress was noted in 30.7% (17.9% of males and 45.0% of females). Female sex and the presence of sequelae were independent risk factors for psychological distress. Of all participants, 29.1% had possible impairments in work performance. Experiences of stigma and discrimination were reported by 43.3% of participants. This study revealed the significant impacts of Long COVID on health in local communities. A large-scale, long-term cohort study is desired.', '[TITLE]: The effect of Covid-19 isolation measures on the cognition and mental health of people living with dementia: a rapid systematic review of one year of evidence. [AUTHORS]: Suarez-Gonzalez, A.; Rajagopalan, J.; Livingston, G.; Alladi, S. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Background: Covid-19 control policies have entailed lockdowns and confinement. Although these isolation measures are thought to be particularly hard and possibly harmful to people with dementia, their specific impact during the pandemic has not yet been synthesised. We aimed to examine and summarise the global research evidence describing the effect of Covid-19 isolation measures on the health of people living with dementia. Method: We searched Pubmed, PsycINFO and CINAHL up to February 2021 for peer-reviewed quantitative studies of the effects of isolation measures during Covid-19 on cognitive, psychological and functional symptoms of people with any kind of dementia or mild cognitive impairment. We summarised the findings of included papers following current guidelines for rapid reviews. Results: We identified 15 eligible papers, examining a total of 6,442 people with dementia. 13/15 were conducted in people living in the community and 2 in care homes. 60% (9/15) studies reported changes in cognition with 77% (7/9) of them describing declined cognition by >50% of respondents. 93% (14/15) of studies reported worsening or new onset of behavioural and psychological symptoms. 46% (7/15) studies reported changes in daily function, 6 of them reporting a functional decline in a variable proportion of the population studied. Conclusion: Lockdowns and confinement measures brought about by the pandemic have damaged the cognitive and psychological health and functional abilities of people with dementia across the world. It is urgent that infection control measures applied to people with dementia are balanced against the principles of non-maleficence. This systematic review makes 4 specific calls for action.', '[TITLE]: The impact of COVID-19 social isolation on aspects of emotional and social cognition. [AUTHORS]: Bland, Amy Rachel; Roiser, Jonathan Paul; Mehta, Mitul Ashok; Sahakian, Barbara Jacquelyn; Robbins, Trevor William; Elliott, Rebecca [JOURNAL]: Cognition & emotion [ABSTRACT]: The present study aimed to examine the impact of COVID-19 social isolation upon aspects of emotional and social cognitive function. We predicted that greater impairments in emotional and social cognition would be observed in people who experienced more disruption to their usual social connectivity during COVID-19 social isolation. Healthy volunteers (N = 92) without prior mental health problems completed assessments online in their own homes during the most stringent period of the first COVID-19 \"lockdown\" in the UK (March - May 2020). Measures included two questionnaires probing levels of social isolation, anxiety levels, as well as five neuropsychological tasks assessing emotional and social cognition. Reduced positive bias in emotion recognition was related to reduced contact with friends, household size and communication method during social isolation. In addition, reduced positive bias for attention to emotional faces was related to frequency of contact with friends during social isolation. Greater cooperative behaviour in an ultimatum game was associated with more frequent contact with both friends and family during social isolation. The present study provides important insights into the detrimental effects of subjective and objective social isolation upon affective cognitive processes.', '[TITLE]: Long COVID: The Nature of Thrombotic Sequelae Determines the Necessity of Early Anticoagulation [AUTHORS]: Wang, Chengyue; Yu, Chengyuan; Jing, Haijiao; Wu, Xiaoming; Novakovic, Valerie A.; Xie, Rujuan; Shi, Jialan [JOURNAL]: Front Cell Infect Microbiol [ABSTRACT]: Many discharged COVID-19 patients affected by sequelae experience reduced quality of life leading to an increased burden on the healthcare system, their families and society at large. Possible pathophysiological mechanisms of long COVID include: persistent viral replication, chronic hypoxia and inflammation. Ongoing vascular endothelial damage promotes platelet adhesion and coagulation, resulting in the impairment of various organ functions. Meanwhile, thrombosis will further aggravate vasculitis contributing to further deterioration. Thus, long COVID is essentially a thrombotic sequela. Unfortunately, there is currently no effective treatment for long COVID. This article summarizes the evidence for coagulation abnormalities in long COVID, with a focus on the pathophysiological mechanisms of thrombosis. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by various types of cells can carry SARS-CoV-2 through the circulation and attack distant tissues and organs. Furthermore, EVs express tissue factor and phosphatidylserine (PS) which aggravate thrombosis. Given the persistence of the virus, chronic inflammation and endothelial damage are inevitable. Pulmonary structural changes such as hypertension, embolism and fibrosis are common in long COVID. The resulting impaired lung function and chronic hypoxia again aggravates vascular inflammation and coagulation abnormalities. In this article, we also summarize recent research on antithrombotic therapy in COVID-19. There is increasing evidence that early anticoagulation can be effective in improving outcomes. In fact, persistent systemic vascular inflammation and dysfunction caused by thrombosis are key factors driving various complications of long COVID. Early prophylactic anticoagulation can prevent the release of or remove procoagulant substances, thereby protecting the vascular endothelium from damage, reducing thrombotic sequelae, and improving quality of life for long-COVID patients.', '[TITLE]: Physical, cognitive, and mental health impacts of COVID-19 after hospitalisation (PHOSP-COVID): a UK multicentre, prospective cohort study [AUTHORS]: Evans, Rachael A; McAuley, Hamish; Harrison, Ewen M; Shikotra, Aarti; Singapuri, Amisha; Sereno, Marco; Elneima, Omer; Docherty, Annemarie B; Lone, Nazir I; Leavy, Olivia C; Daines, Luke; Baillie, J Kenneth; Brown, Jeremy S; Chalder, Trudie; De Soyza, Anthony; Diar Bakerly, Nawar; Easom, Nicholas; Geddes, John R; Greening, Neil J; Hart, Nick; Heaney, Liam G; Heller, Simon; Howard, Luke; Hurst, John R; Jacob, Joseph; Jenkins, R Gisli; Jolley, Caroline; Kerr, Steven; Kon, Onn M; Lewis, Keir; Lord, Janet M; McCann, Gerry P; Neubauer, Stefan; Openshaw, Peter J M; Parekh, Dhruv; Pfeffer, Paul; Rahman, Najib M; Raman, Betty; Richardson, Matthew; Rowland, Matthew; Semple, Malcolm G; Shah, Ajay M; Singh, Sally J; Sheikh, Aziz; Thomas, David; Toshner, Mark; Chalmers, James D; Ho, Ling-Pei; Horsley, Alex; Marks, Michael; Poinasamy, Krisnah; Wain, Louise V; Brightling, Christopher E [JOURNAL]: Lancet Respir Med [ABSTRACT]: BACKGROUND: The impact of COVID-19 on physical and mental health and employment after hospitalisation with acute disease is not well understood. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of COVID-19-related hospitalisation on health and employment, to identify factors associated with recovery, and to describe recovery phenotypes. METHODS: The Post-hospitalisation COVID-19 study (PHOSP-COVID) is a multicentre, long-term follow-up study of adults (aged ≥18 years) discharged from hospital in the UK with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, involving an assessment between 2 and 7 months after discharge, including detailed recording of symptoms, and physiological and biochemical testing. Multivariable logistic regression was done for the primary outcome of patient-perceived recovery, with age, sex, ethnicity, body-mass index, comorbidities, and severity of acute illness as covariates. A post-hoc cluster analysis of outcomes for breathlessness, fatigue, mental health, cognitive impairment, and physical performance was done using the clustering large applications k-medoids approach. The study is registered on the ISRCTN Registry (ISRCTN10980107). FINDINGS: We report findings for 1077 patients discharged from hospital between March 5 and Nov 30, 2020, who underwent assessment at a median of 5·9 months (IQR 4·9–6·5) after discharge. Participants had a mean age of 58 years (SD 13); 384 (36%) were female, 710 (69%) were of white ethnicity, 288 (27%) had received mechanical ventilation, and 540 (50%) had at least two comorbidities. At follow-up, only 239 (29%) of 830 participants felt fully recovered, 158 (20%) of 806 had a new disability (assessed by the Washington Group Short Set on Functioning), and 124 (19%) of 641 experienced a health-related change in occupation. Factors associated with not recovering were female sex, middle age (40–59 years), two or more comorbidities, and more severe acute illness. The magnitude of the persistent health burden was substantial but only weakly associated with the severity of acute illness. Four clusters were identified with different severities of mental and physical health impairment (n=767): very severe (131 patients, 17%), severe (159, 21%), moderate along with cognitive impairment (127, 17%), and mild (350, 46%). Of the outcomes used in the cluster analysis, all were closely related except for cognitive impairment. Three (3%) of 113 patients in the very severe cluster, nine (7%) of 129 in the severe cluster, 36 (36%) of 99 in the moderate cluster, and 114 (43%) of 267 in the mild cluster reported feeling fully recovered. Persistently elevated serum C-reactive protein was positively associated with cluster severity. INTERPRETATION: We identified factors related to not recovering after hospital admission with COVID-19 at 6 months after discharge (eg, female sex, middle age, two or more comorbidities, and more acute severe illness), and four different recovery phenotypes. The severity of physical and mental health impairments were closely related, whereas cognitive health impairments were independent. In clinical care, a proactive approach is needed across the acute severity spectrum, with interdisciplinary working, wide access to COVID-19 holistic clinical services, and the potential to stratify care.

Patients, many with initially ‘mild’ illness, used various kinds of evidence and advocacy to demonstrate a longer, more complex course of illness than laid out in initial reports from Wuhan. Long Covid has a strong claim to be the first illness created through patients finding one another on social media: it moved from patients, through various media, to formal clinical and policy channels in just a few months. This initial mapping of Long Covid – by two patients with this illness – focuses on actors in the UK and USA and demonstrates how patients marshalled epistemic authority. Patient knowledge needs to be incorporated into how COVID-19 is conceptualised, researched, and treated.', \"[TITLE]: A further plot twist: will 'long COVID' have an impact on dentistry and the dental workforce? [AUTHORS]: Agar, Stephanie; Morgan, Elise; Lee, Yee [JOURNAL]: Br Dent J [ABSTRACT]: COVID-19 has dominated our lives since the start of the pandemic in 2020, as well as greatly impacting dentistry, its patients and the dental profession. A new and potentially further problematic phenomenon is that of long COVID, a term used to describe the effects of COVID-19 that continue for weeks, or even months, beyond the initial illness. It is characterised by debilitating symptoms including extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, insomnia, heart palpitations and prolonged high temperature. With one in ten people in the UK suffering from long COVID, there will undoubtedly be a considerable impact on dentistry provision; there will be ramifications not only for patients, but also the workforce, both physically and mentally. The aim of this article is to explore the obstacles we will face due to long COVID, examining possible challenges but also possible solutions.\", '[TITLE]: Multi-organ impairment in low-risk individuals with long COVID [AUTHORS]: Dennis, A.; Wamil, M.; Kapur, S.; Alberts, J.; Badley, A.; Decker, G. A.; Rizza, S. A.; Banerjee, R.; Banerjee, A. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has disproportionately affected older individuals and those with underlying medical conditions. Research has focused on short-term outcomes in hospital, and single organ involvement. Consequently, impact of long COVID (persistent symptoms three months post-infection) across multiple organs in low-risk individuals is yet to be assessed. Methods: An ongoing prospective, longitudinal, two-centre, observational study was performed in individuals symptomatic after recovery from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Symptoms and organ function (heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, pancreas, spleen) were assessed by standardised questionnaires (EQ-5D-5L, Dyspnoea-12), blood investigations and quantitative magnetic resonance imaging, defining single and multi-organ impairment by consensus definitions. Findings: Between April and September 2020, 201 individuals (mean age 44 (SD 11.0) years, 70% female, 87% white, 31% healthcare workers) completed assessments following SARS-CoV-2 infection (median 140, IQR 105-160 days after initial symptoms). The prevalence of pre-existing conditions (obesity: 20%, hypertension: 6%; diabetes: 2%; heart disease: 4%) was low, and only 18% of individuals had been hospitalised with COVID-19. Fatigue (98%), muscle aches (88%), breathlessness (87%), and headaches (83%) were the most frequently reported symptoms. Ongoing cardiorespiratory (92%) and gastrointestinal (73%) symptoms were common, and 42% of individuals had ten or more symptoms. There was evidence of mild organ impairment in heart (32%), lungs (33%), kidneys (12%), liver (10%), pancreas (17%), and spleen (6%). Single (66%) and multi-organ (25%) impairment was observed, and was significantly associated with risk of prior COVID-19 hospitalisation (p<0.05). Interpretation: In a young, low-risk population with ongoing symptoms, almost 70% of individuals have impairment in one or more organs four months after initial symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. There are implications not only for burden of long COVID but also public health approaches which have assumed low risk in young people with no comorbidities.', \"[TITLE]: 'Reluctant pioneer': A qualitative study of doctors' experiences as patients with long COVID [AUTHORS]: Taylor, Anna K.; Kingstone, Tom; Briggs, Tracy A.; O'Donnell, Catherine A.; Atherton, Helen; Blane, David N.; Chew‐Graham, Carolyn A. [JOURNAL]: Health Expect [ABSTRACT]: BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) pandemic has had far‐reaching effects upon lives, healthcare systems and society. Some who had an apparently 'mild' COVID‐19 infection continue to suffer from persistent symptoms, including chest pain, breathlessness, fatigue, cognitive impairment, paraesthesia, muscle and joint pains. This has been labelled 'long COVID'. This paper reports the experiences of doctors with long COVID. METHODS: A qualitative study; interviews with doctors experiencing persistent symptoms were conducted by telephone or video call. Interviews were transcribed and analysis conducted using an inductive and thematic approach. RESULTS: Thirteen doctors participated. The following themes are reported: making sense of symptoms, feeling let down, using medical knowledge and connections, wanting to help and be helped, combining patient and professional identity. Experiencing long COVID can be transformative: many expressed hope that good would come of their experiences. Distress related to feelings of being ‘let down’ and the hard work of trying to access care. Participants highlighted that they felt better able to care for, and empathize with, patients with chronic conditions, particularly where symptoms are unexplained. CONCLUSIONS: The study adds to the literature on the experiences of doctors as patients, in particular where evidence is emerging and the patient has to take the lead in finding solutions to their problems and accessing their own care. PATIENT AND PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: The study was developed with experts by experience (including co‐authors HA and TAB) who contributed to the protocol and ethics application, and commented on analysis and implications. All participants were given the opportunity to comment on findings.\", \"[TITLE]: Cerebral microvascular endothelial glycocalyx damage, its implications on the blood-brain barrier and a possible contributor to cognitive impairment [AUTHORS]: Stoddart, Patrice; Satchell, Simon C; Ramnath, Raina [JOURNAL]: Brain Res [ABSTRACT]: The socio-economic impact of diseases associated with cognitive impairment is increasing. According to the Alzheimer's Society there are over 850,000 people with dementia in the UK, costing the UK £26 billion in 2013. Therefore, research into treatment of those conditions is vital. Research into the cerebral endothelial glycocalyx (CeGC) could offer effective treatments. The CeGC, consisting of proteoglycans, glycoproteins and glycolipids, is a dynamic structure covering the luminal side oftheendothelial cells of capillaries throughout the body. The CeGC is thicker in cerebral micro vessels, suggesting specialisation for its function as part of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Recent research evidences that the CeGC is vital in protecting fragile parenchymal tissue and effective functioning of the BBB, as one particularly important CeGC function is to act as a protective barrier and permeability regulator. CeGC degradation is one of the factors which can lead to an increase in BBB permeability. It occurs naturally in aging, nevertheless, premature degradationhas beenevidencedin multipleconditions linked to cognitive impairment, such as inflammation,brain edema, cerebral malaria, Alzheimer's and recently Covid-19. Increasing knowledge of the mechanisms of CeGC damage has led to research into preventative techniques showing that CeGC is a possible diagnostic marker and a therapeutic target. However, the evidence is relatively new, inconsistent and demonstrated mainly in experimental models. This review evaluates the current knowledge of the CeGC, its structure, functions, damage and repair mechanisms and the impact of its degeneration on cognitive impairment in multiple conditions, highlighting the CeGC as a possible diagnostic marker and a potential target for therapeutic treatment.\", '[TITLE]: Health behaviours the month prior to COVID-19 infection and the development of self-reported long COVID and specific long COVID symptoms: A longitudinal analysis of 1,811 UK adults [AUTHORS]: Paul, E.; Fancourt, D. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Abstract Background Demographic and infection-related characteristics have been identified as risk factors for long COVID, but research on the influence of health behaviours (e.g., exercise, smoking) immediately preceding the index infection is lacking. Methods 1,811 UK adults from the UCL COVID-19 Social Study and who had previously been infected with COVID-19 were analysed. Health behaviours in the month before infection were weekly exercise frequency, days of fresh air per week, sleep quality, smoking, consuming more than the number of recommended alcoholic drinks per week (>14), and the number of mental health care behaviours (e.g., online mental health programme). Logistic regressions controlling for covariates (e.g., COVID-19 infection severity and pre-existing health conditions) examined the impact of health behaviours on long COVID and three long COVID symptoms (difficulty with mobility, cognition, and self-care). Results In the month before infection with COVID-19, poor quality sleep increased the odds of long COVID (odds ratio [OR]: 3.53; (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.01 to 6.21), as did average quality sleep (OR: 2.44; 95% CI: 1.44 to 4.12). Having smoked (OR: 8.39; 95% CI: 1.86 to 37.91) increased and meeting recommended weekly physical activity guidelines (3+ hours) (OR: 0.05; 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.39) reduced the likelihood of difficulty with self-care (e.g., washing all over or dressing) amongst those with long COVID. Conclusion Results point to the importance of sleep quality for long COVID, potentially helping to explain previously demonstrated links between stress and long COVID. Results also suggest that exercise and smoking may be modifiable risk factors for preventing the development of difficulty with self-care.

DESIGN Systematic review with network meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, SCOPUS, and CINAHL from database inception to 31 January 2021. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR STUDY SELECTION Randomised controlled trials comparing psychological interventions with any comparison intervention in adults with chronic, non-specific low back pain. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and confidence in the evidence. Primary outcomes were physical function and pain intensity. A random effects network meta-analysis using a frequentist approach was performed at post-intervention (from the end of treatment to <2 months post-intervention); and at short term (≥2 to <6 months post-intervention), mid-term (≥6 to <12 months post-intervention), and long term follow-up (≥12 months post-intervention). Physiotherapy care was the reference comparison intervention. The design-by-treatment interaction model was used to assess global inconsistency and the Bucher method was used to assess local inconsistency. RESULTS 97 randomised controlled trials involving 13 136 participants and 17 treatment nodes were included. Inconsistency was detected at short term and mid-term follow-up for physical function, and short term follow-up for pain intensity, and were resolved through sensitivity analyses. For physical function, cognitive behavioural therapy (standardised mean difference 1.01, 95% confidence interval 0.58 to 1.44), and pain education (0.62, 0.08 to 1.17), delivered with physiotherapy care, resulted in clinically important improvements at post-intervention (moderate quality evidence). The most sustainable effects of treatment for improving physical function were reported with pain education delivered with physiotherapy care, at least until mid-term follow-up (0.63, 0.25 to 1.00; low quality evidence). No studies investigated the long term effectiveness of pain education delivered with physiotherapy care. For pain intensity, behavioural therapy (1.08, 0.22 to 1.94), cognitive behavioural therapy (0.92, 0.43 to 1.42), and pain education (0.91, 0.37 to 1.45), delivered with physiotherapy care, resulted in clinically important effects at post-intervention (low to moderate quality evidence). Only behavioural therapy delivered with physiotherapy care maintained clinically important effects on reducing pain intensity until mid-term follow-up (1.01, 0.41 to 1.60; high quality evidence). CONCLUSIONS For people with chronic, non-specific low back pain, psychological interventions are most effective when delivered in conjunction with physiotherapy care (mainly structured exercise). Pain education programmes (low to moderate quality evidence) and behavioural therapy (low to high quality evidence) result in the most sustainable effects of treatment; however, uncertainty remains as to their long term effectiveness. Although inconsistency was detected, potential sources were identified and resolved.

We aimed to explore the initial and ongoing symptoms of Long Covid following SARS-CoV-2 infection and describe its impact on daily life. METHODS: We collected self-reported data through an online survey using convenience non-probability sampling. The survey enrolled adults who reported lab-confirmed (PCR or antibody) or suspected COVID-19 who were not hospitalised in the first two weeks of illness. This analysis was restricted to those with self-reported Long Covid. Univariate comparisons between those with and without confirmed COVID-19 infection were carried out and agglomerative hierarchical clustering was used to identify specific symptom clusters, and their demographic and functional correlates. RESULTS: We analysed data from 2550 participants with a median duration of illness of 7.6 months (interquartile range (IQR) 7.1–7.9). 26.5% reported lab-confirmation of infection. The mean age was 46.5 years (standard deviation 11 years) with 82.8% females and 79.9% of participants based in the UK. 89.5% described their health as good, very good or excellent before COVID-19. The most common initial symptoms that persisted were exhaustion, chest pressure/tightness, shortness of breath and headache. Cognitive dysfunction and palpitations became more prevalent later in the illness. Most participants described fluctuating (57.7%) or relapsing symptoms (17.6%). Physical activity, stress, and sleep disturbance commonly triggered symptoms. A third (32%) reported they were unable to live alone without any assistance at six weeks from start of illness. 16.9% reported being unable to work solely due to COVID-19 illness. 37.0% reported loss of income due to illness, and 64.4% said they were unable to perform usual activities/duties. Acute systems clustered broadly into two groups: a majority cluster (n = 2235, 88%) with cardiopulmonary predominant symptoms, and a minority cluster (n = 305, 12%) with multisystem symptoms. Similarly, ongoing symptoms broadly clustered in two groups; a majority cluster (n = 2243, 88.8%) exhibiting mainly cardiopulmonary, cognitive symptoms and exhaustion, and a minority cluster (n = 283, 11.2%) exhibiting more multisystem symptoms. Belonging to the more severe multisystem cluster was associated with more severe functional impact, lower income, younger age, being female, worse baseline health, and inadequate rest in the first two weeks of the illness, with no major differences in the cluster patterns when restricting analysis to the lab-confirmed subgroup. CONCLUSION: This is an exploratory survey of Long Covid characteristics. Whilst this is a non-representative population sample, it highlights the heterogeneity of persistent symptoms, and the significant functional impact of prolonged illness following confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. To study prevalence, predictors and prognosis, research is needed in a representative population sample using standardised case definitions.', '[TITLE]: Persistent neurologic symptoms and cognitive dysfunction in non‐hospitalized Covid‐19 “long haulers” [AUTHORS]: Graham, Edith L.; Clark, Jeffrey R.; Orban, Zachary S.; Lim, Patrick H.; Szymanski, April L.; Taylor, Carolyn; DiBiase, Rebecca M.; Jia, Dan Tong; Balabanov, Roumen; Ho, Sam U.; Batra, Ayush; Liotta, Eric M.; Koralnik, Igor J. [JOURNAL]: Ann Clin Transl Neurol [ABSTRACT]: OBJECTIVE: Most SARS‐CoV‐2‐infected individuals never require hospitalization. However, some develop prolonged symptoms. We sought to characterize the spectrum of neurologic manifestations in non‐hospitalized Covid‐19 “long haulers”. METHODS: This is a prospective study of the first 100 consecutive patients (50 SARS‐CoV‐2 laboratory‐positive (SARS‐CoV‐2(+)) and 50 laboratory‐negative (SARS‐CoV‐2(‐)) individuals) presenting to our Neuro‐Covid‐19 clinic between May and November 2020. Due to early pandemic testing limitations, patients were included if they met Infectious Diseases Society of America symptoms of Covid‐19, were never hospitalized for pneumonia or hypoxemia, and had neurologic symptoms lasting over 6 weeks. We recorded the frequency of neurologic symptoms and analyzed patient‐reported quality of life measures and standardized cognitive assessments. RESULTS: Mean age was 43.2 ± 11.3 years, 70% were female, and 48% were evaluated in televisits. The most frequent comorbidities were depression/anxiety (42%) and autoimmune disease (16%). The main neurologic manifestations were: “brain fog” (81%), headache (68%), numbness/tingling (60%), dysgeusia (59%), anosmia (55%), and myalgias (55%), with only anosmia being more frequent in SARS‐CoV‐2(+) than SARS‐CoV‐2(‐) patients (37/50 [74%] vs. 18/50 [36%]; p < 0.001). Moreover, 85% also experienced fatigue. There was no correlation between time from disease onset and subjective impression of recovery. Both groups exhibited impaired quality of life in cognitive and fatigue domains. SARS‐CoV‐2(+) patients performed worse in attention and working memory cognitive tasks compared to a demographic‐matched US population (T‐score 41.5 [37, 48.25] and 43 [37.5, 48.75], respectively; both p < 0.01). INTERPRETATION: Non‐hospitalized Covid‐19 “long haulers” experience prominent and persistent “brain fog” and fatigue that affect their cognition and quality of life.', \"[TITLE]: Long COVID and episodic disability: advancing the conceptualisation, measurement and knowledge of episodic disability among people living with Long COVID – protocol for a mixed-methods study [AUTHORS]: O'Brien, Kelly K; Brown, Darren A; Bergin, Colm; Erlandson, Kristine M; Vera, Jaime H; Avery, Lisa; Carusone, Soo Chan; Cheung, Angela M; Goulding, Susie; Harding, Richard; McCorkell, Lisa; O'Hara, Margaret; Robinson, Larry; Thomson, Catherine; Wei, Hannah; St Clair-Sullivan, Natalie; Torres, Brittany; Bannan, Ciaran; Roche, Niamh; Stokes, Ruth; Gayle, Patriic; Solomon, Patricia [JOURNAL]: BMJ Open [ABSTRACT]: INTRODUCTION: As the prevalence of Long COVID increases, there is a critical need for a comprehensive assessment of disability. Our aims are to: (1) characterise disability experiences among people living with Long COVID in Canada, UK, USA and Ireland; and (2) develop a patient-reported outcome measure to assess the presence, severity and episodic nature of disability with Long COVID. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In phase 1, we will conduct semistructured interviews with adults living with Long COVID to explore experiences of disability (dimensions, uncertainty, trajectories, influencing contextual factors) and establish an episodic disability (ED) framework in the context of Long COVID (n~10 each country). Using the conceptual framework, we will establish the Long COVID Episodic Disability Questionnaire (EDQ). In phase 2, we will examine the validity (construct, structural) and reliability (internal consistency, test–retest) of the EDQ for use in Long COVID. We will electronically administer the EDQ and four health status criterion measures with adults living with Long COVID, and readminister the EDQ 1 week later (n~170 each country). We will use Rasch analysis to refine the EDQ, and confirm structural and cross-cultural validity. We will calculate Cronbach’s alphas (internal consistency reliability), and intraclass correlation coefficients (test–retest reliability), and examine correlations for hypotheses theorising relationships between EDQ and criterion measure scores (construct validity). Using phase 2 data, we will characterise the profile of disability using structural equation modelling techniques to examine relationships between dimensions of disability and the influence of intrinsic and extrinsic contextual factors. This research involves an academic–clinical–community partnership building on foundational work in ED measurement, Long COVID and rehabilitation. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved by the University of Toronto Research Ethics Board. Knowledge translation will occur with community collaborators in the form of presentations and publications in open access peer-reviewed journals and presentations.\", '[TITLE]: The negative impact of COVID-19 on working memory revealed using a rapid online quiz [AUTHORS]: Baseler, H. A.; Aksoy, M.; Salawu, A.; Green, A.; Asghar, A. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) affects the respiratory system, it can also have neurological consequences leading to cognitive deficits such as memory problems. The aim of our study was to assess the impact of COVID-19 on working memory function. We developed and implemented an online anonymous survey with a working memory quiz incorporating aspects of gamification to engage participants. 5428 participants successfully completed the survey and memory quiz between 8 th December 2020 and 5 th July 2021 (68.6% non-COVID-19 and 31.4% COVID-19). Most participants (93.3%) completed the survey and memory quiz relatively rapidly (mean time of 8.84 minutes). Categorical regression was used to assess the contribution of COVID status, age, time post-COVID (number of months elapsed since having had COVID), symptoms, ongoing symptoms and gender, followed by non-parametric statistics. A principal component analysis explored the relationship between subjective ratings and objective memory scores. The objective memory scores were significantly correlated with participants own assessment of their cognitive function. The factors significantly affecting memory scores were COVID status, age, time post-COVID and ongoing symptoms. Our main finding was a significant reduction in memory scores in all COVID groups (self-reported, positive-tested and hospitalised) compared to the non-COVID group. Memory scores for all COVID groups combined were significantly reduced compared to the non-COVID group in every age category 25 years and over, but not for the youngest age category (18-24 years old). We found that memory scores gradually increased over a period of 17 months post-COVID-19. However, those with ongoing COVID-19 symptoms continued to show a reduction in memory scores. Our findings demonstrate that COVID-19 negatively impacts working memory function, but only in adults aged 25 years and over. Moreover, our results suggest that working memory deficits with COVID-19 can recover over time, although impairments may persist in those with ongoing symptoms.', '[TITLE]: Joint Investigation of 2-Month Post-diagnosis IgG Antibody Levels and Psychological Measures for Assessing Longer Term Multi-Faceted Recovery Among COVID-19 Cases in Northern Cyprus [AUTHORS]: Barin, Burc; Yoldascan, Banu Elcin; Savaskan, Fatma; Ozbalikci, Goncagul; Karaderi, Tugce; Çakal, Hüseyin [JOURNAL]: Front Public Health [ABSTRACT]: Following the outbreak of COVID-19, multidisciplinary research focusing on the long-term effects of the COVID-19 infection and the complete recovery is still scarce. With regards to long-term consequences, biomarkers of physiological effects as well as the psychological experiences are of significant importance for comprehensively understanding the complete COVID-19 recovery. The present research surveys the IgG antibody titers and the impact of COVID-19 as a traumatic experience in the aftermath of the active infection period, around 2 months after diagnosis, in a subset of COVID-19 patients from the first wave (March-April 2020) of the outbreak in Northern Cyprus. Associations of antibody titers and psychological survey measures with baseline characteristics and disease severity were explored, and correlations among various measures were evaluated. Of the 47 serology tests conducted for presence of IgG antibodies, 39 (83%) were positive. We identified trends demonstrating individuals experiencing severe or critical COVID-19 disease and/or those with comorbidities are more heavily impacted both physiologically and mentally, with higher IgG titers and negative psychological experience compared to those with milder disease and without comorbidities. We also observed that more than half of the COVID-19 cases had negative psychological experiences, being subjected to discrimination and verbal harassment/insult, by family/friends. In summary, as the first study co-evaluating immune response together with mental status in COVID-19, our findings suggest that further multidisciplinary research in larger sample populations as well as community intervention plans are needed to holistically address the physiological and psychological effects of COVID-19 among the cases.', \"[TITLE]: Why the Patient-Made Term 'Long Covid' is needed [AUTHORS]: Perego, Elisa Callard Felicity Stras Laurie Melville-Jóhannesson Barbara Pope Rachel Alwan Nisreen [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: The patient-made term ‘Long Covid’ is, we argue, a helpful and capacious term that is needed to address key medical, epidemiological and socio-political challenges posed by diverse symptoms persisting beyond four weeks after symptom onset suggestive of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). An international movement of patients (which includes all six authors) brought the persistence and heterogeneity of long-term symptoms to widespread visibility. The same grassroots movement introduced the term ‘Long Covid’ (and the cognate term ‘long-haulers’) to intervene in relation to widespread assumptions about disease severity and duration. Persistent symptoms following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are now one of the most pressing clinical and public health phenomena to address: their cause(s) is/are unknown, their effects can be debilitating, and the percentage of patients affected is unclear, though likely significant. The term ‘Long Covid’ is now used in scientific literature, the media, and in interactions with the WHO. Uncertainty regarding its value and meaning, however, remains. In this Open Letter, we explain the advantages of the term ‘Long Covid’ and bring clarity to some pressing issues of use and definition. We also point to the importance of centring patient experience and expertise in relation to ‘Long Covid’ research, as well as the provision of care and rehabilitation.\", '[TITLE]: Long COVID-19 and Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome- Is Dysautonomia to Be Blamed? [AUTHORS]: Chadda, Karan R.; Blakey, Ellen E.; Huang, Christopher L. -H.; Jeevaratnam, Kamalan [JOURNAL]: Front Cardiovasc Med [ABSTRACT]: While the increased arrhythmic tendency during acute COVID-19 infection is recognised, the long-term cardiac electrophysiological complications are less well known. There are a high number of patients reporting ongoing symptoms post-infection, termed long COVID. A recent hypothesis is that long COVID symptoms could be attributed to dysautonomia, defined as malfunction of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The most prevalent cardiovascular dysautonomia amongst young people is postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). Numerous reports have described the development of POTS as part of long COVID. Possible underlying mechanisms, although not mutually exclusive or exhaustive, include hypovolaemia, neurotropism, inflammation and autoimmunity. Treatment options for POTS and other long COVID symptoms are currently limited. Future research studies should aim to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of dysautonomia to enable the development of targeted therapies. Furthermore, it is important to educate healthcare professionals to recognise complications and conditions arising from COVID-19, such as POTS, to allow prompt diagnosis and access to early treatment.', '[TITLE]: The Effects of Messaging on Expectations and Understanding of Long COVID: An Online Randomised Trial [AUTHORS]: Bhogal, J. K.; Mills, F.; Dennis, A.; Spoiala, C.; Milward, J.; Saeed, S.; Jones, L. F.; Weston, D.; Carter, H. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Objectives: We examined whether providing different types of information about Long COVID would affect expectations about the illness. Design: A 2 (Illness description: Long COVID vs ongoing COVID-19 recovery) x 2 (Illness uncertainty: uncertainty emphasised vs uncertainty not emphasised) x 2 (Efficacy of support: enhanced support vs basic support) between-subjects randomised online experimental study. Setting: The online platform Prolific, collected in October 2021. Participants: A representative sample of 1110 members of the public in the UK. Interventions: Participants were presented with a scenario describing a positive COVID-19 test result and then presented with one of eight scenarios describing a Long COVID diagnosis. Primary and Secondary Outcome Measures: Various outcome measures relating to illness expectations were captured including: symptom severity, symptom duration, quality of life, personal control, treatment control and illness coherence. Results: We ran a series of 2 x 2 x 2 ANOVAs on the outcome variables. We found a main effect of illness description: individuals reported longer symptom duration and less illness coherence when the illness was described as Long COVID (compared to ongoing COVID-19 recovery). There was a main effect of illness uncertainty: when uncertainty was emphasised, participants reported longer expected symptom duration, less treatment control, and less illness coherence than when uncertainty was not emphasised. There was also a main effect of efficacy of support: participants reported higher personal control and higher treatment control when support was enhanced (compared to basic support). We also found an interaction between illness description and efficacy of support: when support was enhanced, participants reported less illness coherence for Long COVID (compared to ongoing COVID-19 recovery). Conclusions: Communications around Long COVID should not emphasise symptom uncertainty and should provide people with information on how they can facilitate their recovery and where they can access additional support. The findings also suggest that use of the term ongoing COVID-19 recovery, where possible, may reduce negative expectations associated with the illness.', \"[TITLE]: Characteristics of Long Covid: findings from a social media surve [AUTHORS]: Ziauddeen, N.; Gurdasani, D.; O'Hara, M. E.; Hastie, C.; Roderick, P.; Yao, G.; Alwan, N. A. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Many people are not recovering for months after being infected with SARS-CoV-2. Long Covid has emerged as a major public health concern that needs defining, quantifying, and describing. We aimed to explore the initial and ongoing symptoms of Long Covid following SARS-CoV-2 infection and describe its impact on daily life in people who were not admitted to hospital during the first two weeks of the illness. We co-produced a survey with people living with Long Covid. We collected the data through an online survey using convenience non-probability sampling, with the survey posted both specifically on Long Covid support groups and generally on social media. The criteria for inclusion were adults with lab-confirmed (PCR or antibody) or suspected COVID-19 managed in the community (non-hospitalised) in the first two weeks of illness. We used agglomerative hierarchical clustering to identify specific symptom clusters, and their demographic and functional correlates. We analysed data from 2550 participants with a median duration of illness of 7.7 months (interquartile range (IQR) 7.4-8.0). The mean age was 46.5 years (standard deviation 11 years) with 82.8% females and 79.9% of participants based in the UK. 89.5% described their health as good, very good or excellent before COVID-19. The most common initial symptoms that persisted were exhaustion, chest pressure/tightness, shortness of breath and headache. Cough, fever, and chills were common initial symptoms that became less prevalent later in the illness, whereas cognitive dysfunction and palpitations became more prevalent later in the illness. 26.5% reported lab-confirmation of infection. The biggest difference in ongoing symptoms between those who reported testing positive and those who did not was loss of smell/taste. Ongoing symptoms affected at least 3 organ systems in 83.5% of participants. Most participants described fluctuating (57.7%) or relapsing symptoms (17.6%). Physical activity, stress and sleep disturbance commonly triggered symptoms. A third (32%) reported they were unable to live alone without any assistance at six weeks from start of illness. 16.9% reported being unable to work solely due to COVID-19 illness. 66.4% reported taking time off sick (median of 60 days, IQR 20, 129). 37.0% reported loss of income due to illness, and 64.4% said they were unable to perform usual activities/duties. Acute systems clustered broadly into two groups: a majority cluster (n=2235, 88%) with cardiopulmonary predominant symptoms, and a minority cluster (n=305, 12%) with multisystem symptoms. Similarly, ongoing symptoms broadly clustered in two groups; a majority cluster (n=2243, 88.8%) exhibiting mainly cardiopulmonary, cognitive symptoms and exhaustion, and a minority cluster (n=283, 11.2%) exhibited more multisystem symptoms. Belonging to the more severe multisystem cluster was associated with more severe functional impact, lower income, younger age, being female, worse baseline health, and inadequate rest in the first two weeks of the illness, with no major differences in the cluster patterns when restricting analysis to the lab-confirmed subgroup. This is an exploratory survey of Long Covid characteristics. Whilst it is important to acknowledge that it is a non-representative population sample, it highlights the heterogeneity of persistent symptoms, and the significant functional impact of prolonged illness following confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. To study prevalence, predictors and prognosis, research is needed in a representative population sample using standardised case definitions (to include those not lab-confirmed in the first pandemic wave).\", '[TITLE]: Long COVID and its associated factors among COVID survivors in the community from a middle-income country: an online cross-sectional study [AUTHORS]: Moy, F. M.; Hairi, N. N.; Lim, E. R. J.; Bulgiba, A. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Introduction: Patients with COVID-19 usually recover and return to normal health, however some patients may have symptoms that last for weeks or even months after recovery. This persistent state of ill health is known as Long COVID if it continues for more than 12 weeks and are not explained by an alternative diagnosis. Long Covid has been overlooked in low and middle income countries. Therefore, we conducted an online survey among the COVID-19 survivors in the community to explore their Long COVID symptoms, factors associated with Long COVID and how Long COVID affected their work. Methods: This was a cross sectional study conducted from July to September 2021, during the implementation of a nationwide movement control order (MCO). Data was collected using the REDCap electronic data capture tool. The questionnaire was distributed in social and news media. The questionnaire covers information such as socio-demographic characteristics, existing comorbidities, self-perception on health, information on the acute COVID-19 condition and treatment received, symptoms and duration of post-COVID condition and effects on occupation. Results: A total of 732 COVID-19 survivors responded. There were slightly more females (58.7%), younger and more highly educated respondents. More than half of them were overweight or obese and about two third were free of comorbidities. Among these respondents, about 56% were without or with mild symptoms during their acute COVID-19 conditions. A total of 21.1% of the respondents reported to experience Long COVID. The most commonly reported symptoms for Long COVID were fatigue, brain fog, depression, anxiety, insomnia, arthralgia or myalgia. Females had 58% higher odds (95% CI: 1.02, 2.45) of experiencing Long COVID. Patients with moderate and severe levels of acute COVID-19 symptoms had OR of 3.01 (95% CI: 1.21, 7.47) and 3.62 (95% CI: 1.31, 10.03) respectively for Long COVID. Conclusion: This study provides additional insight on the symptoms and duration of post-COVID symptoms as well as the associated factors with Long COVID among COVID-19 survivors in Malaysia. Recognition of Long COVID and its associated factors is important in planning prevention, rehabilitation, clinical management to improve recovery and long-term COVID-19 outcomes.', '[TITLE]: A Systematic Review of the Protective Effect of Prior SARS-CoV-2 Infection on Repeat Infection [AUTHORS]: Kojima, N.; Shrestha, N.; Klausner, J. D. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Introduction: We systematically reviewed studies to estimate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection among those previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: For this systematic review, we searched scientific publications on PubMed and, the pre-print server, MedRxiv through August 18, 2021. Eligible studies were retrieved on August 18, 2021. We used the following search term on PubMed: (((Cohort Studies [Majr]) AND (COVID-19 [Mesh] OR SARS-CoV-2 [Mesh])) OR Reinfection [Majr]) OR Reinfection [Mesh]. We used the following search term on MedRxiv: Cohort Studies AND COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 AND Reinfection. The search terms were broad to encompass all possibilities for applicable studies. There were no restrictions on the date of publication. Studies that did not describe cohorts with estimates of the risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection among those with previous infection were excluded. Studies that included vaccinated participants were either excluded or limited to sub-groups of non-vaccinated individuals. To identify relevant studies with appropriate control groups, we developed the following criteria for studies to be included in the systematic analysis: (1) baseline polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, (2) a negative comparison group, (3) longitudinal follow-up, (4) a cohort of human participants, i.e., not a case report or case series, and (5) outcome determined by PCR. The review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. We assessed for selection, information, and analysis bias, per PRISMA guidelines. Results: We identified 1,392 reports. Of those, 10 studies were eligible for our systematic review. The weighted average risk reduction against reinfection was 90.4% with a standard deviation of 7.7%. Protection against SARS-CoV-2 reinfection was observed for up to 10 months. Studies had potential information, selection, and analysis biases. Conclusions: The protective effect of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection on re-infection is high and similar to the protective effect of vaccination. More research is needed to characterize the duration of protection and the impact of different SARS-CoV-2 variants.', '[TITLE]: Reduction of Cardiac Autonomic Modulation and Increased Sympathetic Activity by Heart Rate Variability in Patients With Long COVID [AUTHORS]: Marques, Karina Carvalho; Silva, Camilla Costa; Trindade, Steffany da Silva; Santos, Márcio Clementino de Souza; Rocha, Rodrigo Santiago Barbosa; Vasconcelos, Pedro Fernando da Costa; Quaresma, Juarez Antônio Simões; Falcão, Luiz Fábio Magno [JOURNAL]: Front Cardiovasc Med [ABSTRACT]: Although several clinical manifestations of persistent long coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been documented, their effects on the cardiovascular and autonomic nervous system over the long term remain unclear. Thus, we examined the presence of alterations in cardiac autonomic functioning in individuals with long-term manifestations. The study was conducted from October 2020 to May 2021, and an autonomic assessment was performed to collect heart rate data for the heart rate variability (HRV) analysis. The study participants were divided into the long COVID clinical group, the intragroup, which included patients who were hospitalized, and those who were not hospitalized and were symptomatic for different periods (≤3, >3, ≤6, and >6 months), with and without dyspnoea. The control group, the intergroup, comprised of COVID-free individuals. Our results demonstrated that the long COVID clinical group showed reduced HRV compared with the COVID-19-uninfected control group. Patients aged 23–59 years developed COVID symptoms within 30 days after infection, whose diagnosis was confirmed by serologic or reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (swab) tests, were included in the study. A total of 155 patients with long COVID [95 women (61.29%), mean age 43.88 ± 10.88 years and 60 men (38.71%), mean age 43.93 ± 10.11 years] and 94 controls [61 women (64.89%), mean age 40.83 ± 6.31 and 33 men (35.11%), mean age 40.69 ± 6.35 years] were included. The intragroup and intergroup comparisons revealed a reduction in global HRV, increased sympathetic modulation influence, and a decrease in parasympathetic modulation in long COVID. The intragroup showed normal sympathovagal balance, while the intergroup showed reduced sympathovagal balance. Our findings indicate that long COVID leads to sympathetic excitation influence and parasympathetic reduction. The excitation can increase the heart rate and blood pressure and predispose to cardiovascular complications. Short-term HRV analysis showed good reproducibility to verify the cardiac autonomic involvement.', '[TITLE]: Immunological dysfunction persists for 8 months following initial mild-moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection [AUTHORS]: Phetsouphanh, C.; Darley, D.; Howe, A.; Munier, C. M. L.; Patel, S. K.; Juno, J. A.; Burrell, L. M.; Kent, S. J.; Dore, G. J.; Kelleher, A. D.; Matthews, G. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: A proportion of patients surviving acute COVID-19 infection develop post-COVID syndrome (long COVID) encompassing physical and neuropsychiatric symptoms lasting longer than 12 weeks. Here we studied a prospective cohort of individuals with long COVID (the ADAPT study) compared to age/gender matched subjects without long COVID, healthy donors and individuals infected with other non-SARS CoV2 human coronaviruses (the ADAPT-C study). We found an elevated diffuse serum inflammatory cytokine profile in symptomatic long COVID subjects that was maintained at 8 months post-infection and was not observed in asymptomatic COVID-19 survivors. This inflammatory profile consisted of 15 cytokines that positively correlated; revealing an apparent diffuse, potentially coordinated, low level up regulation of a spectrum of immune and inflammatory mediators. In addition, we found an absence of subsets of un-activated naive T and B cells in peripheral blood of long COVID subjects, that did not reconstitute over time. In contrast, individual serum cytokines from the interferon I and III classes, T cell activation markers and plasma ACE2, while elevated in the serum of people previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 were not further elevated in subjects with long COVID symptoms. This work defines immunological parameters associated with long COVID and suggests future opportunities to prevention and treatment.', '[TITLE]: Long COVID and Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS)—A Systemic Review and Comparison of Clinical Presentation and Symptomatology [AUTHORS]: Wong, Timothy L.; Weitzer, Danielle J. [JOURNAL]: Medicina (Kaunas) [ABSTRACT]: Background and Objectives: Long COVID defines a series of chronic symptoms that patients may experience after resolution of acute COVID-19. Early reports from studies with patients with long COVID suggests a constellation of symptoms with similarities to another chronic medical illness—myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). A review study comparing and contrasting ME/CFS with reported symptoms of long COVID may yield mutualistic insight into the characterization and management of both conditions. Materials and Methods: A systemic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE and PsycInfo through to 31 January 2021 for studies related to long COVID symptomatology. The literature search was conducted in accordance with PRISMA methodology. Results: Twenty-one studies were included in the qualitative analysis. Long COVID symptoms reported by the included studies were compared to a list of ME/CFS symptoms compiled from multiple case definitions. Twenty-five out of 29 known ME/CFS symptoms were reported by at least one selected long COVID study. Conclusions: Early studies into long COVID symptomatology suggest many overlaps with clinical presentation of ME/CFS. The need for monitoring and treatment for patients post-COVID is evident. Advancements and standardization of long COVID research methodologies would improve the quality of future research, and may allow further investigations into the similarities and differences between long COVID and ME/CFS.', '[TITLE]: How Common is Long COVID in Children and Adolescents? [AUTHORS]: Zimmermann, Petra; Pittet, Laure F.; Curtis, Nigel [JOURNAL]: Pediatr Infect Dis J [ABSTRACT]: In children, the risk of coronavirus disease (COVID) being severe is low. However, the risk of persistent symptoms following infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is uncertain in this age group, and the features of “long COVID” are poorly characterized. We reviewed the 14 studies to date that have reported persistent symptoms following COVID in children and adolescents. Almost all the studies have major limitations, including the lack of a clear case definition, variable follow-up times, inclusion of children without confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, reliance on self- or parent-reported symptoms without clinical assessment, nonresponse and other biases, and the absence of a control group. Of the 5 studies which included children and adolescents without SARS-CoV-2 infection as controls, 2 did not find persistent symptoms to be more prevalent in children and adolescents with evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This highlights that long-term SARS-CoV-2 infection–associated symptoms are difficult to distinguish from pandemic-associated symptoms.', '[TITLE]: Case report and systematic review suggest that children may experience similar long‐term effects to adults after clinical COVID‐19 [AUTHORS]: Ludvigsson, Jonas F. [JOURNAL]: Acta Paediatr [ABSTRACT]: AIM: Persistent symptoms in adults after COVID‐19 are emerging and the term long COVID is increasingly appearing in the literature. However, paediatric data are scarce. METHODS: This paper contains a case report of five Swedish children and the long‐term symptoms reported by their parents. It also includes a systematic literature review of the MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science databases and the medRxiv/bioRxiv pre‐print servers up to 2 November 2020. RESULTS: The five children with potential long COVID had a median age of 12 years (range 9–15) and four were girls. They had symptoms for 6–8 months after their clinical diagnoses of COVID‐19. None were hospitalised at diagnosis, but one was later admitted for peri‐myocarditis. All five children had fatigue, dyspnoea, heart palpitations or chest pain, and four had headaches, difficulties concentrating, muscle weakness, dizziness and sore throats. Some had improved after 6–8 months, but they all suffered from fatigue and none had fully returned to school. The systematic review identified 179 publications and 19 of these were deemed relevant and read in detail. None contained any information on long COVID in children. CONCLUSION: Children may experience similar long COVID symptoms to adults and females may be more affected.', '[TITLE]: Chronic fatigue and post-exertional malaise in people living with long COVID [AUTHORS]: Twomey, R.; DeMars, J.; Franklin, K.; Culos-Reed, S. N.; Weatherald, J.; Wrightson, J. G. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Purpose: People living with long COVID describe a high symptom burden, and a more detailed assessment of chronic fatigue and post-exertional malaise (PEM) may inform the development of rehabilitation recommendations. The aims of this study were to use validated questionnaires to measure the severity of fatigue and compare this with normative data and thresholds for clinical relevance in other diseases; measure and describe the impact of PEM; and describe symptoms of dysfunctional breathing, self-reported physical activity/sitting time, and health-related quality of life. Methods: This was an observational study involving an online survey for adults living with long COVID (data collection from February-April, 2021) following a confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Questionnaires included the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue Scale (FACIT-F) and DePaul Symptom Questionnaire-Post-Exertional Malaise. Results: After data cleaning, n=213 participants were included in the analysis. Participants primarily identified as women (85.5%), aged 40-59 (78.4%), who had been experiencing long COVID symptoms for [≥]6 months (72.3%). The total FACIT-F score was 18{+/-}10 (where the score can range from 0-52, and a lower score indicates more severe fatigue), and 71.4% were experiencing chronic fatigue. Post-exertional symptom exacerbation affected most participants, and 58.7% met the scoring thresholds used in people living with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome. PEM occurred alongside a reduced capacity to work, be physically active, and function both physically and socially. Conclusion: Long COVID is characterized by chronic fatigue that is clinically relevant and is at least as severe as fatigue in several other clinical conditions, including cancer. PEM appears to be a common and significant challenge for the majority of this patient group. Patients, researchers, and allied health professionals are seeking information on safe rehabilitation for people living with long COVID, particularly regarding exercise. Fatigue and post-exertional symptom exacerbation must be monitored and reported in studies involving interventions for people with long COVID.', '[TITLE]: Epipharyngeal Abrasive Therapy (EAT) Has Potential as a Novel Method for Long COVID Treatment [AUTHORS]: Imai, Kazuaki; Yamano, Takafumi; Nishi, Soichiro; Nishi, Ryushiro; Nishi, Tatsuro; Tanaka, Hiroaki; Tsunoda, Toshiyuki; Yoshimoto, Shohei; Tanaka, Ayaki; Hiromatsu, Kenji; Shirasawa, Senji; Nakagawa, Takashi; Nishi, Kensuke [JOURNAL]: Viruses [ABSTRACT]: COVID-19 often causes sequelae after initial recovery, referred to collectively as long COVID. Long COVID is considered to be caused by the persistence of chronic inflammation after acute COVID-19 infection. We found that all long COVID patients had residual inflammation in the epipharynx, an important site of coronavirus replication, and some long COVID symptoms are similar to those associated with chronic epipharyngitis. Epipharyngeal abrasive therapy (EAT) is a treatment for chronic epipharyngitis in Japan that involves applying zinc chloride as an anti-inflammatory agent to the epipharyngeal mucosa. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of EAT for the treatment of long COVID. The subjects in this study were 58 patients with long COVID who were treated with EAT in the outpatient department once a week for one month (mean age = 38.4 ± 12.9 years). The intensities of fatigue, headache, and attention disorder, which are reported as frequent symptoms of long COVID, were assessed before and after EAT using the visual analog scale (VAS). EAT reduced inflammation in the epipharynx and significantly improved the intensity of fatigue, headache, and attention disorder, which may be related to myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). These results suggest that EAT has potential as a novel method for long COVID treatment.', '[TITLE]: Clearing the Fog: A Systematic Review on Cognitive Dysfunction in COVID-19 [AUTHORS]: Butardo, N. D.; Coronel, M. F. D.; Dino, A. M. O.; Mendoza, T. R. F.; Sto. Domingo, O. K. D.; Regencia, Z. J. G.; Dominguez, J. C.; Baja, E. S.; Ligsay, A. D. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Objective: The systematic review aims to examine the association between COVID-19 and cognitive dysfunction, including the link between the severity of COVID-19 and the occurrence of cognitive impairment and the potential pathophysiological mechanisms related to brain fog among COVID-19 patients. Methods: PubMed, Oxford University Press, ProQuest Health and Medical Complete, ScienceDirect, Ovid, HERDIN, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library databases were accessed to retrieve literature using the PRISMA guidelines. Results: After critical appraisal, thirteen full journal articles were included in the study. The studies showed the most frequent cognitive impairment are attention, memory, and executive function in COVID-19 patients. Compared with healthy controls (HC) in 3 out of 4 studies, cognitive impairment was only evident in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, two studies showed no correlation between brain fog and depression, and five studies showed a link between the severity of COVID-19 infection and cognitive impairment. Cases ranging from mild to severe illness presented manifestations of brain fog. However, a disparity in the evidence of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and cognitive dysfunction exists, prompting the need to investigate further. Additionally, recent studies provide insufficient evidence for direct central nervous system invasion, and there are emerging studies that contrast the presumed pathogenesis of neurological complications from neuroinflammation. Conclusion: There is an association between COVID-19 and cognitive dysfunction. Manifestation of cognitive dysfunction is present regardless of illness severity. Moreover, there are existing pathophysiological mechanisms of the Coronavirus that lead to cognitive dysfunction in COVID-19 patients; however, additional studies are required to substantiate such mechanisms further.', '[TITLE]: Persistent Lung Injury and Prothrombotic State in Long COVID [AUTHORS]: Xiang, Mengqi; Jing, Haijiao; Wang, Chengyue; Novakovic, Valerie A.; Shi, Jialan [JOURNAL]: Front Immunol [ABSTRACT]: Lung injury may persist during the recovery period of COVID-19 as shown through imaging, six-minute walk, and lung function tests. The pathophysiological mechanisms leading to long COVID have not been adequately explained. Our aim is to investigate the basis of pulmonary susceptibility during sequelae and the possibility that prothrombotic states may influence long-term pulmonary symptoms of COVID-19. The patient’s lungs remain vulnerable during the recovery stage due to persistent shedding of the virus, the inflammatory environment, the prothrombotic state, and injury and subsequent repair of the blood-air barrier. The transformation of inflammation to proliferation and fibrosis, hypoxia-involved vascular remodeling, vascular endothelial cell damage, phosphatidylserine-involved hypercoagulability, and continuous changes in serological markers all contribute to post-discharge lung injury. Considering the important role of microthrombus and arteriovenous thrombus in the process of pulmonary functional lesions to organic lesions, we further study the possibility that prothrombotic states, including pulmonary vascular endothelial cell activation and hypercoagulability, may affect long-term pulmonary symptoms in long COVID. Early use of combined anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy is a promising approach to reduce the incidence of pulmonary sequelae. Essentially, early treatment can block the occurrence of thrombotic events. Because impeded pulmonary circulation causes large pressure imbalances over the alveolar membrane leading to the infiltration of plasma into the alveolar cavity, inhibition of thrombotic events can prevent pulmonary hypertension, formation of lung hyaline membranes, and lung consolidation.', \"[TITLE]: Clinical coding of long COVID in English primary care: a federated analysis of 58 million patient records in situ using OpenSAFELY [AUTHORS]: The OpenSAFELY Collaborative,; Walker, A.

J.; Evans, S. J.; Smeeth, L.; Goldacre, B. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Background Long COVID is a term to describe new or persistent symptoms at least four weeks after onset of acute COVID-19. Clinical codes to describe this phenomenon were released in November 2020 in the UK, but it is not known how these codes have been used in practice. Methods Working on behalf of NHS England, we used OpenSAFELY data encompassing 96% of the English population. We measured the proportion of people with a recorded code for long COVID, overall and by demographic factors, electronic health record software system, and week. We also measured variation in recording amongst practices. Results Long COVID was recorded for 23,273 people. Coding was unevenly distributed amongst practices, with 26.7% of practices having not used the codes at all. Regional variation was high, ranging between 20.3 per 100,000 people for East of England (95% confidence interval 19.3-21.4) and 55.6 in London (95% CI 54.1-57.1). The rate was higher amongst women (52.1, 95% CI 51.3-52.9) compared to men (28.1, 95% CI 27.5-28.7), and higher amongst practices using EMIS software (53.7, 95% CI 52.9-54.4) compared to TPP software (20.9, 95% CI 20.3-21.4). Conclusions Long COVID coding in primary care is low compared with early reports of long COVID prevalence. This may reflect under-coding, sub-optimal communication of clinical terms, under-diagnosis, a true low prevalence of long COVID diagnosed by clinicians, or a combination of factors. We recommend increased awareness of diagnostic codes, to facilitate research and planning of services; and surveys of clinicians' experiences, to complement ongoing patient surveys.\", '[TITLE]: Similar patterns of 18F-FDG brain PET hypometabolism in paediatric and adult patients with long COVID: a paediatric case series [AUTHORS]: Morand, Aurelie Campion Jacques-Yves Lepine Anne Bosdure Emmanuelle Lucciani Léa Cammilleri Serge Chabrol Brigitte Guedj Eric [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Purpose: Several weeks after COVID-19 infection, some children report the persistence or recurrence of functional complaints. This clinical presentation has been referred as “long COVID” in the adult population, and an 18 F-FDG brain PET hypometabolic pattern has recently been suggested as a biomarker. Herein, we present a retrospective analysis of 7 paediatric patients with suspected long COVID who were explored by 18 F-FDG brain PET exam. Metabolic brain findings were confronted to those obtained in adult patients with long COVID, in comparison to their respective age-matched control groups. Methods: . Review of clinical examination, and whole-brain voxel-based analysis of 18 F-FDG PET metabolism of the 7 children in comparison to 20 paediatric controls, 35 adult patients with long COVID and 44 healthy adult subjects. Results: . Paediatric patients demonstrated a similair brain hypometabolic pattern as that found in adult long COVID patients, involving bilateral medial temporal lobes, brainstem and cerebellum (p-voxel < 0.001, p-cluster < 0.05 FWE-corrected), and also the right olfactory gyrus after small volume correction (p-voxel = 0.010 FWE-corrected), with partial recovery in two children at follow-up. Conclusion: These results provide arguments in favour of possible long COVID in children, with a similar functional brain involvement to those found in adults .', '[TITLE]: Validity of reported post-acute health outcomes in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection: a systematic review [AUTHORS]: Hirt, J.; Janiaud, P.; Gloy, V.; Schandelmaier, S.; Pereira, T. V.; Contopoulos-Ioannidis, D. G.; Goodman, S. N.; Ioannidis, J. P. A.; Munkholm, K.; Hemkens, L. G. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Importance: There is concern that post-acute SARS-CoV-2 infection health outcomes (\"post-COVID syndrome\") in children could be a serious problem but at the same time there is concern about the validity of reported associations between infection and long-term outcomes. Objective: To systematically assess the validity of reported post-acute SARS-CoV-2 infection health outcomes in children. Evidence Review: A search on PubMed and Web of Science was conducted to identify studies published up to January 22, 2022, that reported on post-acute SARS-CoV-2 infection health outcomes in children (<18 years) with a minimum follow-up of 2 months since detection of infection or 1 month since recovery from acute illness. We assessed the consideration of confounding bias and causality, and the risk of bias. Findings: 21 studies including 81,896 children reported up to 97 symptoms with follow-up periods of 2-11.5 months. Fifteen studies had no control group. The reported proportion of children with post-COVID syndrome was between 0% and 66.5% in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection (n=16,986) and 2% to 53.3% in children without SARS-CoV-2 infection (n=64,910). Only 2 studies made a clear causal interpretation of an association of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the main outcome of \"post-COVID syndrome\" and provided recommendations regarding prevention measures. Two studies mentioned potential limitations in the conclusion of the main text but none of the 21 studies mentioned any limitations in the abstract nor made a clear statement for cautious interpretation. The validity of all 21 studies was seriously limited due to an overall critical risk of bias (critical risk for confounding bias [n=21]; serious or critical risk for selection bias [n=19]; serious risk for misclassification bias [n=3], for bias due to missing data [n=14] and for outcome measurement [n=12]; and critical risk for selective reporting bias [n=16]). Conclusions and Relevance: The validity of reported post-acute SARS-CoV-2 infection health outcomes in children is critically limited. None of the studies provided evidence with reasonable certainty on whether SARS-CoV-2 infection has an impact on post-acute health outcomes, let alone to what extent. Children and their families urgently need much more reliable and methodologically robust evidence to address their concerns and improve care.', '[TITLE]: Long COVID in a prospective cohort of home-isolated patients [AUTHORS]: Blomberg, Bjørn; Mohn, Kristin Greve-Isdahl; Brokstad, Karl Albert; Zhou, Fan; Linchausen, Dagrun Waag; Hansen, Bent-Are; Lartey, Sarah; Onyango, Therese Bredholt; Kuwelker, Kanika; Sævik, Marianne; Bartsch, Hauke; Tøndel, Camilla; Kittang, Bård Reiakvam; Cox, Rebecca Jane; Langeland, Nina [JOURNAL]: Nat Med [ABSTRACT]: Long-term complications after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are common in hospitalized patients, but the spectrum of symptoms in milder cases needs further investigation. We conducted a long-term follow-up in a prospective cohort study of 312 patients—247 home-isolated and 65 hospitalized—comprising 82% of total cases in Bergen during the first pandemic wave in Norway. At 6 months, 61% (189/312) of all patients had persistent symptoms, which were independently associated with severity of initial illness, increased convalescent antibody titers and pre-existing chronic lung disease. We found that 52% (32/61) of home-isolated young adults, aged 16–30 years, had symptoms at 6 months, including loss of taste and/or smell (28%, 17/61), fatigue (21%, 13/61), dyspnea (13%, 8/61), impaired concentration (13%, 8/61) and memory problems (11%, 7/61). Our findings that young, home-isolated adults with mild COVID-19 are at risk of long-lasting dyspnea and cognitive symptoms highlight the importance of infection control measures, such as vaccination.', '[TITLE]: Humility and Acceptance: Working Within Our Limits With Long COVID and Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. [AUTHORS]: Décary, Simon; Gaboury, Isabelle; Poirier, Sabrina; Garcia, Christiane; Simpson, Scott; Bull, Michelle; Brown, Darren; Daigle, Frédérique [JOURNAL]: The Journal of orthopaedic and sports physical therapy [ABSTRACT]: SYNOPSIS The term long COVID was coined by patients to describe the long-term consequences of COVID-19. One year into the pandemic, it was clear that all patients-those hospitalized with COVID-19 and those who lived with the disease in the community-were at risk of developing debilitating sequelae that would impact their quality of life. Patients with long COVID asked for rehabilitation. Many of them, including previously healthy and fit clinicians, tried to fight postviral fatigue with exercise-based rehabilitation. We observed a growing number of patients with long COVID who experienced adverse effects from exercise therapy and symptoms strikingly similar to those of myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME). Community-based physical therapists, including those in private practice, unaware of safety issues, are preparing to help an influx of patients with long COVID. In this editorial, we expose growing concerns about long COVID and ME. We issue safety recommendations for rehabilitation and share resources to improve care for those with postviral illnesses.

Its etiology is unclear and it often follows a mild acute illness. Anecdotal reports of gradual clinical responses to histamine receptor antagonists (HRAs) suggest a histamine-dependent mechanism that is distinct from anaphylaxis, possibly mediated by T cells, which are also regulated by histamine. T cell perturbations have been previously reported in post-viral syndromes, but the T cell landscape in patients who have recovered from mild COVID-19 and its relationship to both long COVID symptoms and any symptomatic response to HRA remain underexplored. We addressed these questions in an observational study of 65 individuals who had recovered from mild COVID-19. Participants were surveyed between 87 and 408 days after the onset of acute symptoms; none had required hospitalization, 16 had recovered uneventfully, and 49 had developed long COVID. Symptoms were quantified using a structured questionnaire and T cell subsets enumerated in a standard diagnostic assay. Patients with long-COVID had reduced CD4+ and CD8+ effector memory (EM) cell numbers and increased PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1) expression on central memory (CM) cells, whereas the asymptomatic participants had reduced CD8+ EM cells only and increased CD28 expression on CM cells. 72% of patients with long COVID who received HRA reported clinical improvement, although T cell profiling did not clearly distinguish those who responded to HRA. This study demonstrates that T cell perturbations persist for several months after mild COVID-19 and are associated with long COVID symptoms.', '[TITLE]: Estimating the extent of true asymptomatic COVID-19 and its potential for community transmission: systematic review and meta-analysis [AUTHORS]: Byambasuren, O.; Cardona, M.; Bell, K.; Clark, J.; McLaws, M.-L.; Glasziou, P. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Background: The prevalence of true asymptomatic COVID-19 cases is critical to policy makers considering the effectiveness of mitigation measures against the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We aimed to synthesize all available research on the asymptomatic rates and transmission rates where possible. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane COVID-19 trials, and European PMC for pre-print platforms such as MedRxiv. We included primary studies reporting on asymptomatic prevalence where: (a) the sample frame includes at-risk population, and (b) there was sufficiently long follow up to identify pre-symptomatic cases. Meta-analysis used fixed effect and random effects models. Results: We screened 571 articles and included five low risk-of-bias studies from three countries (China (2), USA (2), Italy (1)) that tested 9,242 at-risk people, of which 413 were positive and 65 were asymptomatic. Diagnosis in all studies was confirmed using a RT-qPCR test. The proportion of asymptomatic cases ranged from 6% to 41%. Meta-analysis (fixed effect) found that the proportion of asymptomatic cases was 16% (95% CI: 12% - 20%) overall; higher in non-aged care 19% (15% - 24%), and lower in long-term aged care 8% (4% - 14%). Two studies provided direct evidence of forward transmission of the infection by asymptomatic cases but suggested lower rates than symptomatic cases. Conclusion: Our estimates of the prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases are lower than many highly publicized studies, but still substantial. Further robust epidemiological evidence is urgently needed, including in sub-populations such as children, to better understand the importance of asymptomatic cases for driving spread of the pandemic.', '[TITLE]: Neuropsychological deficits in patients with cognitive complaints after COVID‐19 [AUTHORS]: García‐Sánchez, Carmen; Calabria, Marco; Grunden, Nicholas; Pons, Catalina; Arroyo, Juan Antonio; Gómez‐Anson, Beatriz; Lleó, Alberto; Alcolea, Daniel; Belvís, Roberto; Morollón, Noemí; Mur, Isabel; Pomar, Virginia; Domingo, Pere [JOURNAL]: Brain Behav [ABSTRACT]: BACKGROUND: While much of the scientific focus thus far has been on cognitive sequelae in patients with severe COVID‐19, subjective cognitive complaints are being reported across the spectrum of disease severity, with recent studies beginning to corroborate patients’ perceived deficits. In response to this, the aims of this study were to (1) explore the frequency of impaired performance across cognitive domains in post‐COVID patients with subjective complaints and (2) uncover whether impairment existed within a single domain or across multiple. METHODS: Sixty‐three patients with subjective cognitive complaints post‐COVID were assessed with a comprehensive protocol consisting of various neuropsychological tests and mood measures. Cognitive test performance was transformed into T scores and classified based on recommended guidelines. After performing a principal component analysis to define cognitive domain factors, distributions of test scores within and across domains were analyzed. RESULTS: Results revealed pervasive impact on attention abilities, both as the singularly affected domain (19% of single‐domain impairment) as well as coupled with decreased performance in executive functions, learning, and long‐term memory. These salient attentional and associated executive deficits were largely unrelated to clinical factors such as hospitalization, disease duration, biomarkers, or affective measures. DISCUSSION: These findings stress the importance of comprehensive evaluation and intervention to address cognitive sequelae in post‐COVID patients of varying disease courses, not just those who were hospitalized or experienced severe symptoms. Future studies should investigate to what extent these cognitive abilities are recuperated over time as well as employ neuroimaging techniques to uncover underlying mechanisms of neural damage.', '[TITLE]: Post-acute COVID-19 Syndrome Negatively Impacts Physical Function, Cognitive Function, Health-Related Quality of Life, and Participation [AUTHORS]: Tabacof, Laura; Tosto-Mancuso, Jenna; Wood, Jamie; Cortes, Mar; Kontorovich, Amy; McCarthy, Dayna; Rizk, Dahlia; Rozanski, Gabriela; Breyman, Erica; Nasr, Leila; Kellner, Christopher; Herrera, Joseph E.; Putrino, David [JOURNAL]: Am J Phys Med Rehabil [ABSTRACT]: This report describes persistent symptoms associated with post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS) and the impact of these symptoms on physical function, cognitive function, health-related quality of life, and participation. DESIGN: This study used a cross-sectional observational study design. Patients attending Mount Sinai’s post-acute COVID-19 syndrome clinic completed surveys containing patient-reported outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 156 patients completed the survey, at a median (range) time of 351 days (82–457 days) after COVID-19 infection. All patients were prevaccination. The most common persistent symptoms reported were fatigue (n = 128, 82%), brain fog (n = 105, 67%), and headache (n = 94, 60%). The most common triggers of symptom exacerbation were physical exertion (n = 134, 86%), stress (n = 107, 69%), and dehydration (n = 77, 49%). Increased levels of fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale) and dyspnea (Medical Research Council) were reported, alongside reductions in levels of regularly completed physical activity. Ninety-eight patients (63%) scored for at least mild cognitive impairment (Neuro-Qol), and the domain of the EuroQol: 5 dimension, 5 level most impacted was Self-care, Anxiety/Depression and Usual Activities. CONCLUSIONS: Persistent symptoms associated with post-acute COVID-19 syndrome seem to impact physical and cognitive function, health-related quality of life, and participation in society. More research is needed to further clarify the relationship between COVID-19 infection and post-acute COVID-19 syndrome symptoms, the underlying mechanisms, and treatment options.', '[TITLE]: A systematic review of the impact of intensive care admissions on post discharge cognition in children [AUTHORS]: Royer, Ana Sánchez-Moreno; Busari, Jamiu O. [JOURNAL]: Eur J Pediatr [ABSTRACT]: Understanding how hospitalization affects cognitive development is crucial to safeguard children’s cognition; however, there is little research evaluating the associations between NICU or PICU hospitalization and survivors’ cognition. The objective of this study is to identify and characterize the associations between a neonatal or pediatric ICU hospitalization and the short- and long-term cognition of survivors. The databases Cochrane Library, Medline, EBSCO, Embase, and Google Scholar and the journals JAMA Pediatrics, Journal of Pediatrics, Pediatrics, Archives of Disease in Childhood, Academic Pediatrics, Pediatric Critical Care Medicine and Child Development were searched until April 2021. Retrieved article references were analyzed. Included articles investigated cognition as an outcome of ICU hospitalization in non-preterm neonatal or pediatric patients. Case studies and studies analyzing diagnosis or treatment interventions were excluded. Four prospective cohort or case-control studies and two retrospective cohort studies were included, totaling 2172 neonatal and 42368 pediatric patients. Quality assessment using the BMJ Criteria and Cochrane Collaboration’s Risk-of-Bias tool displayed good results. Significant negative associations were found between neonatal cognition and length-of-ICU-stay at 9- (p<0.001) and 24 months (p<0.01), and between pediatric cognition and length-of-ICU-stay at discharge (p<0.001). Additional weeks on the neonatal ICU increased odds of impairment at 9- (OR 1.08, 95%CI 1.034–1.112) and 24 months (OR 1.11, 95%CI 1.065–1.165). Conclusion: There is a significant negative correlation between NICU and PICU hospitalization and the short- and long-term cognitive status.

[JOURNAL]: EClinicalMedicine [ABSTRACT]: BACKGROUND: Preliminary evidence has highlighted a possible association between severe COVID-19 and persistent cognitive deficits. Further research is required to confirm this association, determine whether cognitive deficits relate to clinical features from the acute phase or to mental health status at the point of assessment, and quantify rate of recovery. METHODS: 46 individuals who received critical care for COVID-19 at Addenbrooke's hospital between 10th March 2020 and 31st July 2020 (16 mechanically ventilated) underwent detailed computerised cognitive assessment alongside scales measuring anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder under supervised conditions at a mean follow up of 6.0 (± 2.1) months following acute illness. Patient and matched control (N = 460) performances were transformed into standard deviation from expected scores, accounting for age and demographic factors using N = 66,008 normative datasets. Global accuracy and response time composites were calculated (G_SScore & G_RT). Linear modelling predicted composite score deficits from acute severity, mental-health status at assessment, and time from hospital admission. The pattern of deficits across tasks was qualitatively compared with normal age-related decline, and early-stage dementia. FINDINGS: COVID-19 survivors were less accurate (G_SScore=-0.53SDs) and slower (G_RT=+0.89SDs) in their responses than expected compared to their matched controls. Acute illness, but not chronic mental health, significantly predicted cognitive deviation from expected scores (G_SScore (p=\\u200b\\u200b0.0037) and G_RT (p = 0.0366)). The most prominent task associations with COVID-19 were for higher cognition and processing speed, which was qualitatively distinct from the profiles of normal ageing and dementia and similar in magnitude to the effects of ageing between 50 and 70 years of age. A trend towards reduced deficits with time from illness (r∼=0.15) did not reach statistical significance. INTERPRETATION: Cognitive deficits after severe COVID-19 relate most strongly to acute illness severity, persist long into the chronic phase, and recover slowly if at all, with a characteristic profile highlighting higher cognitive functions and processing speed.

[AUTHORS]: Cools, Roshan; Arnsten, Amy F T [JOURNAL]: Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology [ABSTRACT]: The primate prefrontal cortex (PFC) subserves our highest order cognitive operations, and yet is tremendously dependent on a precise neurochemical environment for proper functioning. Depletion of noradrenaline and dopamine, or of acetylcholine from the dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC), is as devastating as removing the cortex itself, and serotonergic influences are also critical to proper functioning of the orbital and medial PFC. Most neuromodulators have a narrow inverted U dose response, which coordinates arousal state with cognitive state, and contributes to cognitive deficits with fatigue or uncontrollable stress. Studies in monkeys have revealed the molecular signaling mechanisms that govern the generation and modulation of mental representations by the dlPFC, allowing dynamic regulation of network strength, a process that requires tight regulation to prevent toxic actions, e.g., as occurs with advanced age. Brain imaging studies in humans have observed drug and genotype influences on a range of cognitive tasks and on PFC circuit functional connectivity, e.g., showing that catecholamines stabilize representations in a baseline-dependent manner. Research in monkeys has already led to new treatments for cognitive disorders in humans, encouraging future research in this important field.', '[TITLE]: SARS-CoV-2 is associated with changes in brain structure in UK Biobank [AUTHORS]: Douaud, Gwenaëlle; Lee, Soojin; Alfaro-Almagro, Fidel; Arthofer, Christoph; Wang, Chaoyue; McCarthy, Paul; Lange, Frederik; Andersson, Jesper L. R.; Griffanti, Ludovica; Duff, Eugene; Jbabdi, Saad; Taschler, Bernd; Keating, Peter; Winkler, Anderson M.; Collins, Rory; Matthews, Paul M.; Allen, Naomi; Miller, Karla L.; Nichols, Thomas E.; Smith, Stephen M. [JOURNAL]: Nature [ABSTRACT]: There is strong evidence of brain-related abnormalities in COVID-19(1–13). However, it remains unknown whether the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection can be detected in milder cases, and whether this can reveal possible mechanisms contributing to brain pathology. Here we investigated brain changes in 785 participants of UK Biobank (aged 51–81 years) who were imaged twice using magnetic resonance imaging, including 401 cases who tested positive for infection with SARS-CoV-2 between their two scans—with 141 days on average separating their diagnosis and the second scan—as well as 384 controls. The availability of pre-infection imaging data reduces the likelihood of pre-existing risk factors being misinterpreted as disease effects. We identified significant longitudinal effects when comparing the two groups, including (1) a greater reduction in grey matter thickness and tissue contrast in the orbitofrontal cortex and parahippocampal gyrus; (2) greater changes in markers of tissue damage in regions that are functionally connected to the primary olfactory cortex; and (3) a greater reduction in global brain size in the SARS-CoV-2 cases. The participants who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 also showed on average a greater cognitive decline between the two time points. Importantly, these imaging and cognitive longitudinal effects were still observed after excluding the 15 patients who had been hospitalised. These mainly limbic brain imaging results may be the in vivo hallmarks of a degenerative spread of the disease through olfactory pathways, of neuroinflammatory events, or of the loss of sensory input due to anosmia. Whether this deleterious effect can be partially reversed, or whether these effects will persist in the long term, remains to be investigated with additional follow-up.', '[TITLE]: Are vaccines safe in patients with Long COVID?

[JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Introduction: Although the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination to prevent symptomatic COVID-19 is well established, there are no published studies on the impact on symptoms in patients with Long Covid. Anecdotal reports have suggested both a potential benefit and worsening of symptoms post vaccination with the uncertainty leading to some vaccine hesitancy amongst affected individuals. Methods: Patients initially hospitalised with COVID-19 were prospectively recruited to an observational study with clinical follow-up at 3 months (June-July 2020) and 8 months (Dec 2020-Jan 2021) post-admission. Participants who received the Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) or Oxford-AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) vaccine between January to February 2021 were identified and matched 2:1 (in terms of 8-month symptoms) with participants from the same cohort who were unvaccinated. All were re-assessed at 1 month post vaccination (or matched timepoint for unvaccinated cohort). Validated quality of life (SF-36), mental wellbeing (WEMWBS) and ongoing symptoms were assessed at all timepoints. Formal statistical analysis compared the effect of vaccination on recent quality of life using baseline symptoms, age, and gender in linear regression. Results: Forty-four vaccinated participants were assessed at a median of 32 days (IQR 20-41) post vaccination with 22 matched unvaccinated participants. Most were highly symptomatic of Long Covid at 8 months (82% in both groups had at least 1 persistent symptom), with fatigue (61%), breathlessness (50%) and insomnia (38%) predominating. There was no significant worsening in quality-of-life or mental wellbeing metrics pre versus post vaccination. Nearly two-thirds (n=27) reported transient (<72hr duration) systemic effects (including fever, myalgia and headache). When compared to matched unvaccinated participants from the same cohort, those who had receive a vaccine had a small overall improvement in Long Covid symptoms, with a decrease in worsening symptoms (5.6% vaccinated vs 14.2% unvaccinated) and increase in symptom resolution (23.2% vaccinated vs 15.4% unvaccinated) (p=0.035). No difference in response was identified between Pfizer-BioNTech or Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines. Conclusions: Receipt of vaccination with either an mRNA or adenoviral vector vaccine was not associated with a worsening of Long Covid symptoms, quality of life, or mental wellbeing. Individuals with prolonged COVID-19 symptoms should receive vaccinations as suggested by national guidance.', '[TITLE]: Survivorship after COVID-19 ICU stay [AUTHORS]: Hosey, Megan M.; Needham, Dale M. [JOURNAL]: Nat Rev Dis Primers [ABSTRACT]: Prior studies of patient survivorship after an intensive care unit (ICU) stay suggest that many critically ill patients with COVID-19 will face long-lasting physical, cognitive and/or mental health impairments. This anticipated survivorship experience highlights the importance of collaboration between the fields of critical care and rehabilitation to optimize post-COVID-19 recovery.', \"[TITLE]: Microglial depletion with CSF1R inhibitor during chronic phase of experimental traumatic brain injury reduces neurodegeneration and neurological deficits. [AUTHORS]: Henry, Rebecca J; Ritzel, Rodney M; Barrett, James P; Doran, Sarah J; Jiao, Yun; Leach, Jennie B; Szeto, Gregory L; Wu, Junfang; Stoica, Bogdan A; Faden, Alan I; Loane, David J [JOURNAL]: The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience [ABSTRACT]: Chronic neuroinflammation with sustained microglial activation occurs following severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and is believed to contribute to subsequent neurodegeneration and neurological deficits . Microglia, the primary innate immune cells in brain, are dependent on colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) signaling for their survival. In this pre-clinical study, we examined the effects of delayed depletion of chronically activated microglia on functional recovery and neurodegeneration up to three months post-injury. A CSF1R inhibitor, PLX5622, was administered to adult male C57Bl/6J mice at one month after controlled cortical impact to remove chronically activated microglia, and the inhibitor was withdrawn 1-week later to allow for microglial repopulation. Following TBI, the repopulated microglia displayed a ramified morphology similar to that of sham uninjured mice, whereas microglia in vehicle-treated TBI mice showed the typical chronic posttraumatic hypertrophic morphology. PLX5622 treatment limited TBI-associated neuropathological changes at 3 months post-injury; these included a smaller cortical lesion, reduced hippocampal neuron cell death, and decreased NOX2- and NLRP3 inflammasome-associated neuroinflammation. Furthermore, delayed depletion of chronically activated microglia after TBI led to widespread changes in the cortical transcriptome and altered gene pathways involved in neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and neuroplasticity. Using a variety of complementary neurobehavioral tests, PLX5622-treated TBI mice also had improved long-term motor and cognitive function recovery through 3 months post-injury. Together, these studies demonstrate that chronic phase removal of neurotoxic microglia after TBI using CSF1R inhibitors markedly reduce chronic neuroinflammation and associated neurodegeneration, as well as related motor and cognitive deficits.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTTraumatic brain injury (TBI) is a debilitating neurological disorder that can seriously impact the patient's quality of life. Microglial-mediated neuroinflammation is induced after severe TBI and contributes to neurological deficits and on-going neurodegenerative processes. Here, we investigated the effect of breaking the neurotoxic neuroinflammatory loop at 1-month after controlled cortical impact in mice by pharmacological removal of chronically activated microglia using a CSF1R inhibitor, PLX5622. Overall, we show that short-term elimination of microglia during the chronic phase of TBI followed by repopulation results in long-term improvements in neurological function, suppression of neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress pathways, and a reduction in persistent neurodegenerative processes. These studies are clinically relevant and support new concepts that the therapeutic window for TBI may be far longer than traditionally believed if chronic and evolving microglial-mediated neuroinflammation can be inhibited or regulated in a precise manner.\", '[TITLE]: Changes in cognitive functioning after COVID‐19: A systematic review and meta‐analysis [AUTHORS]: Crivelli, Lucia; Palmer, Katie; Calandri, Ismael; Guekht, Alla; Beghi, Ettore; Carroll, William; Frontera, Jennifer; García‐Azorín, David; Westenberg, Erica; Winkler, Andrea Sylvia; Mangialasche, Francesca; Allegri, Ricardo F.; Kivipelto, Miia [JOURNAL]: Alzheimers Dement [ABSTRACT]: INTRODUCTION: We conducted a systematic review and meta‐analysis of the cognitive effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) in adults with no prior history of cognitive impairment. METHODS: Searches in Medline/Web of Science/Embase from January 1, 2020, to December 13, 2021, were performed following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A meta‐analysis of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) total score comparing recovered COVID‐19 and healthy controls was performed. RESULTS: Oof 6202 articles, 27 studies with 2049 individuals were included (mean age = 56.05 years, evaluation time ranged from the acute phase to 7 months post‐infection). Impairment in executive functions, attention, and memory were found in post‐COVID‐19 patients. The meta‐analysis was performed with a subgroup of 290 individuals and showed a difference in MoCA score between post‐COVID‐19 patients versus controls (mean difference = −0.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] −1.59, −0.29; P = .0049). DISCUSSION: Patients recovered from COVID‐19 have lower general cognition compared to healthy controls up to 7 months post‐infection.', '[TITLE]: Screening for SARS-CoV-2 persistence in Long COVID patients using sniffer dogs and scents from axillary sweats samples [AUTHORS]: GRANDJEAN, D.; SLAMA, D.; GALLET, C.; JULIEN, C.; SEYRAT, E.; BLONDOT, M.; BENAZAZIEZ, M.; ELBAZ, J.; SALMON, D. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Objectives: Dogs can be trained to identify several substances not detected by humans, corresponding to specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The presence of VOCs, triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection, was tested in sweat from Long COVID patients. Patients and methods: An axillary sweat sample of Long COVID patients and of COVID-19 negative, asymptomatic individuals was taken at home to avoid any hospital contact. Swabs were randomly placed in olfaction detection cones, and the material sniffed by at least 2 trained dogs. Results: Forty-five Long COVID patients, mean age 45 (6-71), 73.3% female, with prolonged symptoms evolving for a mean of 15.2 months (5-22) were tested. Dogs discriminated in a positive way 23/45 (51.1%) Long COVID patients versus 0/188 (0%) control individuals (p<.0001). Conclusion:This study suggests the persistence of a viral infection in some Long COVID patients and the possibility of providing a simple, highly sensitive, non-invasive test to detect viral presence, during acute and extended phases of COVID-19.', '[TITLE]: Long COVID in the Faroe Islands - a longitudinal study among non-hospitalized patients [AUTHORS]: Petersen, Maria Skaalum; Kristiansen, Marnar Fríðheim; Hanusson, Katrin Dahl; Danielsen, Marjun Eivindardóttir; á Steig, Bjarni; Gaini, Shahin; Strøm, Marin; Weihe, Pál [JOURNAL]: Clin Infect Dis [ABSTRACT]: BACKGROUND: Little is known about long-term recovery from COVID-19 disease, especially in non-hospitalized individuals. In this longitudinal study we present symptoms registered during the acute phase as well as long COVID, i.e. long-lasting COVID-19 symptoms, in patients from the Faroe Islands. METHODS: All consecutive patients with confirmed RT-PCR testing from April to June 2020 were invited to participate in this study for the assessment of long COVID. Demographic and clinical characteristics and self-reported acute and persistent symptoms were assessed using a standardized detailed questionnaire administered at enrollment and at repeated phone interviews in the period 22 (th) April to Aug 16 (th). RESULTS: Of the 180 participants (96.3% of the 187 eligible COVID-19 patients), 53.1% reported persistence of at least one symptom after a mean of 125 days after symptoms onset, 33.3% reported one or two symptoms and 19.4% three or more symptoms. At the last follow-up, 46.7% were asymptomatic compared with 4.4 % during the acute phase. The most prevalent persistent symptoms were fatigue, loss of smell and taste, and arthralgias. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that it might take months for symptoms to resolve, even among non-hospitalized persons with mild illness course in the acute phase. Continued monitoring for long COVID is needed.', '[TITLE]: Long term outcomes in survivors of epidemic Influenza A (H7N9) virus infection [AUTHORS]: Chen, Jiajia; Wu, Jie; Hao, Shaorui; Yang, Meifang; Lu, Xiaoqing; Chen, Xiaoxiao; Li, Lanjuan [JOURNAL]: Sci Rep [ABSTRACT]: Patients who survive influenza A (H7N9) virus infection are at risk of physical and psychological complications of lung injury and multi-organ dysfunction. However, there were no prospectively individualized assessments of physiological, functional and quality-of-life measures after hospital discharge. The current study aims to assess the main determinants of functional disability of these patients during the follow-up. Fifty-six influenza A (H7N9) survivors were investigated during the 2-year after discharge from the hospital. Results show interstitial change and fibrosis on pulmonary imaging remained 6 months after hospital discharge. Both ventilation and diffusion dysfunction improved, but restrictive and obstructive patterns on ventilation function test persisted throughout the follow-up period. For patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome lung functions improved faster during the first six months. Role-physical and Role-emotional domains in the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey were worse than those of a sex- and age-matched general population group. The quality of life of survivors with ARDS was lower than those with no ARDS. Our findings suggest that pulmonary function and imaging findings improved during the first 6 months especially for those with ARDS, however long-term lung disability and psychological impairment in H7N9 survivors persisted at 2 years after discharge from the hospital.', '[TITLE]: Prevalence, characteristics, and predictors of Long COVID among diagnosed cases of COVID-19 [AUTHORS]: M C, A.; Singh, A. K.; Pal, D.; Das, K.; Gajjala, A.; Venkateshan, M.; Mishra, B.; Patro, B. K.; Mohapatra, P. R.; Subba, S. H. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Background: Long COVID or long-term complication after COVID-19 has the ability to affect health and quality of life. Knowledge about the burden and predictors could aid in their prevention and management. Most of the studies are from high-income countries and focus on severe cases. We did this study to estimate the prevalence and identify the characteristics and predictors of Long COVID among our patients. Methodology: We recruited adult ([≥]18 years) patients who were diagnosed as Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RTPCR) confirmed SARS-COV-2 infection and were either hospitalized or tested on outpatient basis. Eligible participants were followed up telephonically after four weeks of diagnosis of SARS-COV-2 infection to collect data on sociodemographic, clinical history, vaccination history, Cycle threshold (Ct) values during diagnosis and other variables. Characteristic of Long COVID were elicited, and multivariable logistic regression was done to find the predictors of Long COVID. Results: We have analyzed 487 individual data with a median follow-up of 44 days (Inter quartile range (IQR): 39,47). Overall, Long COVID was reported by 29.2% (95% Confidence interval (CI): 25.3%,33.4%) participants. Prevalence of Long COVID among patients with mild/moderate disease (n = 415) was 23.4% (95% CI: 19.5%,27.7%) as compared to 62.5% (95% CI: 50.7%,73%) in severe/critical cases(n=72). The most common Long COVID symptom was fatigue (64.8%) followed by cough (32.4%). Statistically significant predictors of Long COVID were - Pre-existing medical conditions (Adjusted Odds ratio (aOR)=2.00, 95% CI: 1.16,3.44), having a more significant number of symptoms during acute phase of COVID-19 disease (aOR=11.24, 95% CI: 4.00,31.51), two doses of COVID-19 vaccination (aOR=2.32, 95% CI: 1.17,4.58), the severity of illness (aOR=5.71, 95% CI: 3.00,10.89) and being admitted to hospital (Odds ratio (OR)=3.89, 95% CI: 2.49,6.08). Conclusion: A considerable proportion of COVID-19 cases reported Long COVID symptoms. More research is needed in Long COVID to objectively assess the symptoms and find the biological and radiological markers.', '[TITLE]: The prevalence of adaptive immunity to COVID-19 and reinfection after recovery, a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of 12 011 447 individuals [AUTHORS]: Chivese, T.; Matizanadzo, J.; Musa, O.; Hindy, G.; Furuya-Kanamori, L.; Islam, N.; Al-Shebly, R.; Shalaby, R.; Habibullah, M.; Al-Marwani, T.; Hourani, R. F.; Nawaz, A. D.; Haider, M.; Emara, M. M.; Cyprian, F.; Doi, S. A. R. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Abstract Objectives This study aims to estimate the prevalence and longevity of detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as well as T and B memory cells during infection with SARS-CoV-2 and after recovery. In addition, prevalence of COVID-19 reinfection, and the preventive efficacy of previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 were investigated. Methods and analyses A synthesis of existing research was conducted. The Cochrane Library for COVID-19 resources, the China Academic Journals Full Text Database, PubMed, and Scopus as well as preprint servers were searched for studies conducted between 1 January 2020 to 1 April 2021. We included studies with the relevant outcomes of interest. All included studies were assessed for methodological quality and pooled estimates of relevant outcomes were obtained in a meta-analysis using a bias adjusted synthesis method. Proportions were synthesized with the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation and binary outcomes using the odds ratio (OR). Heterogeneity between included studies was assessed using the I2 and Cochrans Q statistics and publication bias was assessed using Doi plots. Results Fifty-four studies, from 18 countries, with a total of 12 011 447 individuals, followed up to 8 months after recovery were included. At 6-8 months after recovery, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 specific immunological memory remained high; IgG 90.4% (95%CI 72.2 to 99.9, I2=89.0%, 5 studies), CD4+ 91.7% (95%CI 78.2 to 97.1, one study), and memory B cells 80.6% (95%CI 65.0 to 90.2, one study) and the pooled prevalence of reinfection was 0.2% (95%CI 0.0 to 0.7, I2 = 98.8, 9 studies). Individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 had an 81% reduction in odds of a reinfection (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.3, I2 = 90.5%, 5 studies). Conclusion Around 90% of people previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 had evidence of immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2, which was sustained for at least 6-8 months after recovery, and had a low risk of reinfection.', '[TITLE]: Depressive symptoms in response to COVID-19 and lockdown: a cross-sectional study on the Italian population [AUTHORS]: Delmastro, Marco; Zamariola, Giorgia [JOURNAL]: Sci Rep [ABSTRACT]: The COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown orders adopted to prevent the spread of the disease had a huge impact on a personal, social, and economic level for the world population. In Europe, Italy was one of the frontrunner countries dealing with an emergency that significantly affected people’s lives. Previous research on the psychological impact of the pandemic revealed an increase in anxiety, depression, and feelings of distress; however, these studies were conducted on non-representative samples of the population reached through social media channels, a method that is likely to lead to many forms of statistical and methodological bias. For the first time to our knowledge, we assessed the psychological impact of COVID-19 on 6700 Italian individuals, representative of the Italian population in terms of age, gender, and geographical areas revealing higher scores of depressive symptoms in females, younger adults, people reporting professional uncertainty and lower socio-economic status. A positive correlation was also found for individuals living alone, those who could not leave home for going to work, and people with a case of COVID-19 in the family, whereas the region of residence was not a significant predictor of depressive symptoms. These findings underline the importance of considering the psychological effects of COVID-19 and providing support to individuals seeking mental health care.', '[TITLE]: The impact of COVID-19 on people ageing with an intellectual disability in Ireland: Protocol for a follow-up survey [AUTHORS]: McCarron, Mary; Allen, Andrew; McCausland, Darren; Haigh, Margaret; Luus, Retha; Bavussantakath, Fathima Rosmin; Sheerin, Fintan; Mulryan, Niamh; Burke, Eilish; McGlinchey, Eimear; Flannery, Fidelma; McCallion, Philip [JOURNAL]: HRB Open Res [ABSTRACT]: Background: The COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns have had a dramatic impact on many people, but individuals with an intellectual disability, given the prevalence of congregate living and high levels of co-morbid conditions, may be particularly vulnerable at this time. A prior initial survey of participants of the Intellectual Disability Supplement to the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (IDS-TILDA) found that, despite a majority of participants being tested, only a small proportion had tested positive for COVID-19. Furthermore, despite some reporting positive aspects to the lockdown, a similar proportion were experiencing stress or anxiety during the pandemic. The pandemic and lockdowns have continued, and it is possible that experiences and consequences have changed over time. Aim: To explore over time and in greater depth the impact of COVID-19 and associated lockdowns and to further establish rates of infection, rates of vaccination and participants’ experiences. Methods: A structured questionnaire for people with intellectual disability participating in the IDS-TILDA longitudinal study, to be administered by telephone/video in summer 2021. Where participants are unable to respond independently, a proxy respondent will be invited to either assist the participant or answer questions on their behalf. This questionnaire will include questions from the first COVID-19 questionnaire, with extra questions assessing “long COVID” (i.e. COVID-19 lasting for 12 weeks or longer), infection control behaviours, changes in mental health, social contacts and loneliness, frailty, healthcare, and incidence of vaccination. Impact: The results of this survey will be used to inform healthcare provision for people with intellectual disability during the latter stages of the lockdown and into the future.', '[TITLE]: Effects of Vivifrail multicomponent intervention on functional capacity: a multicentre, randomized controlled trial [AUTHORS]: Casas‐Herrero, Álvaro; Sáez de Asteasu, Mikel L.; Antón‐Rodrigo, Iván; Sánchez‐Sánchez, Juan Luis; Montero‐Odasso, Manuel; Marín‐Epelde, Itxaso; Ramón‐Espinoza, Fernanda; Zambom‐Ferraresi, Fabricio; Petidier‐Torregrosa, Roberto; Elexpuru‐Estomba, Jaione; Álvarez‐Bustos, Alejandro; Galbete, Arkaitz; Martínez‐Velilla, Nicolás; Izquierdo, Mikel [JOURNAL]: J Cachexia Sarcopenia Muscle [ABSTRACT]: BACKGROUND: Physical exercise is an effective strategy for preserving functional capacity and improving the symptoms of frailty in older adults. In addition to functional gains, exercise is considered to be a cornerstone for enhancing cognitive function in frail older adults with cognitive impairment and dementia. We assessed the effects of the Vivifrail exercise intervention for functional capacity, cognition, and well‐being status in community‐dwelling older adults. METHODS: In a multicentre randomized controlled trial conducted in three tertiary hospitals in Spain, a total of 188 older patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia (aged >75 years) were randomly assigned to an exercise intervention (n = 88) or a usual‐care, control (n = 100) group. The intervention was based on the Vivifrail tailored multicomponent exercise programme, which included resistance, balance, flexibility (3 days/week), and gait‐retraining exercises (5 days/week) and was performed for three consecutive months (http://vivifrail.com). The usual‐care group received habitual outpatient care. The main endpoint was change in functional capacity from baseline to 1 and 3 months, assessed with the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). Secondary endpoints were changes in cognitive function and handgrip strength after 1 and 3 months, and well‐being status, falls, hospital admission rate, visits to the emergency department, and mortality after 3 months. RESULTS: The Vivifrail exercise programme provided significant benefits in functional capacity over usual‐care. The mean adherence to the exercise sessions was 79% in the first month and 68% in the following 2 months. The intervention group showed a mean increase (over the control group) of 0.86 points on the SPPB scale (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.32, 1.41 points; P < 0.01) after 1 month of intervention and 1.40 points (95% CI 0.82, 1.98 points; P < 0.001) after 3 months. Participants in the usual‐care group showed no significant benefit in functional capacity (mean change of −0.17 points [95% CI −0.54, 0.19 points] after 1 month and −0.33 points [95% CI −0.70, 0.04 points] after 3 months), whereas the exercise intervention reversed this trend (0.69 points [95% CI 0.29, 1.09 points] after 1 month and 1.07 points [95% CI 0.63, 1.51 points] after 3 months). Exercise group also obtained significant benefits in cognitive function, muscle function, and depression after 3 months over control group (P < 0.05). No between‐group differences were obtained in other secondary endpoints (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The Vivifrail exercise training programme is an effective and safe therapy for improving functional capacity in community‐dwelling frail/prefrail older patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia and also seems to have beneficial effect on cognition, muscle function, and mood status.', '[TITLE]: Medium-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on multiple vital organs, exercise capacity, cognition, quality of life and mental health, post-hospital discharge [AUTHORS]: Raman, B.; Cassar, M.

R.; Harrison, P.; Pattinson, K.; Rowland, M. J. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Background The medium-term effects of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on multiple organ health, exercise capacity, cognition, quality of life and mental health are poorly understood. Methods Fifty-eight COVID-19 patients post-hospital discharge and 30 comorbidity-matched controls were prospectively enrolled for multiorgan (brain, lungs, heart, liver and kidneys) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), spirometry, six-minute walk test, cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), quality of life, cognitive and mental health assessments. Findings At 2-3 months from disease-onset, 64% of patients experienced persistent breathlessness and 55% complained of significant fatigue. On MRI, tissue signal abnormalities were seen in the lungs (60%), heart (26%), liver (10%) and kidneys (29%) of patients. COVID-19 patients also exhibited tissue changes in the thalamus, posterior thalamic radiations and sagittal stratum on brain MRI and demonstrated impaired cognitive performance, specifically in the executive and visuospatial domain relative to controls. Exercise tolerance (maximal oxygen consumption and ventilatory efficiency on CPET) and six-minute walk distance (405{+/-}118m vs 517{+/-}106m in controls, p<0.0001) were significantly reduced in patients. The extent of extra-pulmonary MRI abnormalities and exercise tolerance correlated with serum markers of ongoing inflammation and severity of acute illness. Patients were more likely to report symptoms of moderate to severe anxiety (35% versus 10%, p=0.012) and depression (39% versus 17%, p=0.036) and significant impairment in all domains of quality of life compared to controls. Interpretation A significant proportion of COVID-19 patients discharged from hospital experience ongoing symptoms of breathlessness, fatigue, anxiety, depression and exercise limitation at 2-3 months from disease-onset. Persistent lung and extra-pulmonary organ MRI findings are common. In COVID-19 survivors, chronic inflammation may underlie multiorgan abnormalities and contribute to impaired quality of life.', '[TITLE]: Immune profile of children with post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Long Covid) [AUTHORS]: Di Sante, G.; Buonsenso, D.; De Rose, C.; Valentini, P.; Ria, F.; Sanguinetti, M.; Sali, M. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: There is increasing reporting by patients organization and researchers of long covid (or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 - PASC), characterized by symptoms such as fatigue, dyspnea, chest pain, cognitive and sleeping disturbances, arthralgia and decline in quality of life. Immune system dysregulation with a hyperinflammatory state, direct viral toxicity, endothelial damage and microvascular injury have been proposed as pathologenic mechanisms. Recently, cohorts of children with PASC have been reported in Italy, Sweden and Russia. However, immunological studies of children with PASC have never been performed. In this study, we documented significant immunologic differences between children that completely recovered from acute infection and those with PASC, providing the first objective laboratory sign of the existence of PASC in children.', '[TITLE]: Clinical characteristics with inflammation profiling of Long-COVID and association with one-year recovery following hospitalisation in the UK: a prospective observational study [AUTHORS]: Evans, R.

P.; Neubauer, S.; Openshaw, P [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Background There are currently no effective pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions for Long-COVID. To identify potential therapeutic targets, we focussed on previously described four recovery clusters five months after hospital discharge, their underlying inflammatory profiles and relationship with clinical outcomes at one year. Methods PHOSP-COVID is a prospective longitudinal cohort study, recruiting adults hospitalised with COVID-19 across the UK. Recovery was assessed using patient reported outcomes measures (PROMs), physical performance, and organ function at five-months and one-year after hospital discharge. Hierarchical logistic regression modelling was performed for patient-perceived recovery at one-year. Cluster analysis was performed using clustering large applications (CLARA) k-medoids approach using clinical outcomes at five-months. Inflammatory protein profiling from plasma at the five-month visit was performed. Findings 2320 participants have been assessed at five months after discharge and 807 participants have completed both five-month and one-year visits. Of these, 35.6% were female, mean age 58.7 (SD 12.5) years, and 27.8% received invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). The proportion of patients reporting full recovery was unchanged between five months 501/165 (25.6%) and one year 232/804 (28.9%). Factors associated with being less likely to report full recovery at one year were: female sex OR 0.68 (95% CI 0.46-0.99), obesity OR 0.50 (95%CI 0.34-0.74) and IMV OR 0.42 (95%CI 0.23-0.76). Cluster analysis (n=1636) corroborated the previously reported four clusters: very severe, severe, moderate/cognitive, mild relating to the severity of physical, mental health and cognitive impairments at five months in a larger sample. There was elevation of inflammatory mediators of tissue damage and repair in both the very severe and the moderate/cognitive clusters compared to the mild cluster including interleukin-6 which was elevated in both comparisons. Overall, there was a substantial deficit in median (IQR) EQ5D-5L utility index from pre-COVID (retrospective assessment) 0.88 (0.74-1.00), five months 0.74 (0.60-0.88) to one year: 0.74 (0.59-0.88), with minimal improvements across all outcome measures at one-year after discharge in the whole cohort and within each of the four clusters. Interpretation The sequelae of a hospital admission with COVID-19 remain substantial one year after discharge across a range of health domains with the minority in our cohort feeling fully recovered. Patient perceived health-related quality of life remains reduced at one year compared to pre-hospital admission. Systematic inflammation and obesity are potential treatable traits that warrant further investigation in clinical trials.', '[TITLE]: COVID Stress Syndrome: Clinical and Nosological Considerations [AUTHORS]: Taylor, Steven [JOURNAL]: Curr Psychiatry Rep [ABSTRACT]: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review the current state of knowledge on the newly proposed COVID Stress Syndrome. RECENT FINDINGS: The syndrome consists of five inter-correlated elements: (a) fear of SARSCoV2 infection and fear of coming into contact with objects or surfaces contaminated with the coronavirus; (b) fear of socio-economic impacts of the pandemic; (c) fear of foreigners for fear that they are infected; (d) pandemic-related compulsive checking and reassurance-seeking; and (e) pandemic-related traumatic stress symptoms. A severe form of the syndrome, characterized by clinically significant distress and impairment in functioning, is the COVID Stress Disorder, which is regarded as a pandemic-related adjustment disorder. Several treatment options exist but further research is needed. SUMMARY: Research during the COVID-19 pandemic has identified a pandemic-related adjustment disorder. The diagnosis of COVID Stress Syndrome should be made only after ruling out other disorders that could potentially account for the pattern of symptoms, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder. Further studies are needed to investigate the long-term course of the syndrome. Similar adjustment disorders may arise in future pandemics. Accordingly, understanding the COVID Stress Syndrome may facilitate efforts to understand and treat psychopathology in future pandemics.', '[TITLE]: Long COVID in Children and Adolescents: A Systematic Review and Meta-analyses. [AUTHORS]: Lopez-Leon, S.; Wegman-Ostrosky, T.; Ayuzo del Valle, N. C.; Perelman, C.; Sepulveda, R.; Rebolledo, P. A.; Cuapio, A.; Villapol, S. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Objective: To estimate the prevalence of long COVID in children and adolescents and identify the full spectrum of signs and symptoms present after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: Two independent investigators searched PubMed and Embase in order to identify observational studies that met the following criteria: 1) a minimum of 30 patients, 2) ages ranged from 0 to 18 years, 3) published in English, 4) published before February 10th, 2022, and 5) meets the National Institute for Healthcare Excellence (NICE) definition of long COVID, which consists of both ongoing (4 to 12 weeks) and post COVID 19 ([≥]12 weeks) symptoms. For COVID symptoms reported in two or more studies, random-effects meta-analyses were performed using the MetaXL software to estimate the pooled prevalence, and Review Manager (RevMan) software 5.4 was utilized to estimate the Odds Ratios (ORs) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity was assessed using I2 statistics. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviewers and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) reporting guideline was followed (registration PROSPERO CRD42021275408). Results: The literature search yielded 68 articles for long COVID in children and adolescents. After screening, 21 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the systematic review and meta-analyses. A total of 80,071 children and adolescents with COVID-19 were included. The prevalence of long COVID was 25.24% (95% CI 18.17-33.02), and the most prevalent clinical manifestations were mood symptoms (16.50%; 95% CI 7.37-28.15), fatigue (9.66%; 95% CI 4.45-16.46), and sleep disorders (8.42%; 95% CI 3.41-15.20). When compared to controls, children infected by SARS-CoV-2 had a higher risk of persistent dyspnea (OR 2.69 95%CI 2.30-3.14), anosmia/ageusia (OR 10.68, 95%CI 2.48, 46.03), and/or fever (OR 2.23, 95%CI 1.22-4.07). The main limitation of these meta-analyses is the probability of bias, which includes lack of standardized definitions, recall, selection, misclassification, nonresponse and/or loss of follow-up, and the high level of heterogeneity. Conclusion: These meta-analyses provide an overview of the broad symptomatology of long COVID in minors, which may help improve management, rehabilitation programs, and future development of guidelines and therapeutic research for COVID-19.', '[TITLE]: Persistent symptoms after Covid-19: qualitative study of 114 “long Covid” patients and draft quality principles for services [AUTHORS]: Ladds, Emma; Rushforth, Alex; Wieringa, Sietse; Taylor, Sharon; Rayner, Clare; Husain, Laiba; Greenhalgh, Trisha [JOURNAL]: BMC Health Serv Res [ABSTRACT]: BACKGROUND: Approximately 10% of patients with Covid-19 experience symptoms beyond 3–4 weeks. Patients call this “long Covid”. We sought to document such patients’ lived experience, including accessing and receiving healthcare and ideas for improving services. METHODS: We held 55 individual interviews and 8 focus groups (n = 59) with people recruited from UK-based long Covid patient support groups, social media and snowballing. We restricted some focus groups to health professionals since they had already self-organised into online communities. Participants were invited to tell their stories and comment on others’ stories. Data were audiotaped, transcribed, anonymised and coded using NVIVO. Analysis incorporated sociological theories of illness, healing, peer support, clinical relationships, access, and service redesign. RESULTS: Of 114 participants aged 27–73 years, 80 were female. Eighty-four were White British, 13 Asian, 8 White Other, 5 Black, and 4 mixed ethnicity. Thirty-two were doctors and 19 other health professionals. Thirty-one had attended hospital, of whom 8 had been admitted. Analysis revealed a confusing illness with many, varied and often relapsing-remitting symptoms and uncertain prognosis; a heavy sense of loss and stigma; difficulty accessing and navigating services; difficulty being taken seriously and achieving a diagnosis; disjointed and siloed care (including inability to access specialist services); variation in standards (e.g. inconsistent criteria for seeing, investigating and referring patients); variable quality of the therapeutic relationship (some participants felt well supported while others felt “fobbed off”); and possible critical events (e.g. deterioration after being unable to access services). Emotionally significant aspects of participants’ experiences informed ideas for improving services. CONCLUSION: Suggested quality principles for a long Covid service include ensuring access to care, reducing burden of illness, taking clinical responsibility and providing continuity of care, multi-disciplinary rehabilitation, evidence-based investigation and management, and further development of the knowledge base and clinical services.

The experience of Long Covid gives a contemporary example of how working together with patients is integral to medical research.', '[TITLE]: Course of post COVID-19 disease symptoms over time in the ComPaRe long COVID prospective e-cohort [AUTHORS]: Tran, Viet-Thi; Porcher, Raphaël; Pane, Isabelle; Ravaud, Philippe [JOURNAL]: Nat Commun [ABSTRACT]: About 10% of people infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 experience post COVID-19 disease. We analysed data from 968 adult patients (5350 person-months) with a confirmed infection enroled in the ComPaRe long COVID cohort, a disease prevalent prospective e-cohort of such patients in France. Day-by-day prevalence of post COVID-19 symptoms was determined from patients’ responses to the Long COVID Symptom Tool, a validated self-reported questionnaire assessing 53 symptoms. Among patients symptomatic after 2 months, 85% still reported symptoms one year after their symptom onset. Evolution of symptoms showed a decreasing prevalence over time for 27/53 symptoms (e.g., loss of taste/smell); a stable prevalence over time for 18/53 symptoms (e.g., dyspnoea), and an increasing prevalence over time for 8/53 symptoms (e.g., paraesthesia). The disease impact on patients’ lives began increasing 6 months after onset. Our results are of importance to understand the natural history of post COVID-19 disease.', '[TITLE]: Visual interpretation of brain hypometabolism related to neurological long COVID: a French multicentric experience [AUTHORS]: Verger, Antoine; Kas, Aurélie; Dudouet, Pierre; Goehringer, François; Salmon-Ceron, Dominique; Guedj, Eric [JOURNAL]: Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging [ABSTRACT]: BACKGROUND: This multicentre study aimed to provide a qualitative and consensual description of brain hypometabolism observed through the visual analysis of (18)F-FDG PET images of patients with suspected neurological long COVID, regarding the previously reported long-COVID hypometabolic pattern involving hypometabolism in the olfactory bulbs and other limbic/paralimbic regions, as well as in the brainstem and cerebellum. METHODS: From the beginning of August 2021 to the end of October 2021, the brain (18)F-FDG PET scans of patients referred for suspected neurological long COVID with positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and/or serology tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection were retrospectively reviewed in three French nuclear medicine departments (143 patients; 47.4 years old ± 13.6; 98 women). Experienced nuclear physicians from each department classified brain (18)F-FDG PET scans according to the same visual interpretation analysis as being normal, mildly to moderately (or incompletely) affected, or otherwise severely affected within the previously reported long-COVID hypometabolic pattern. RESULTS: On the 143 brain (18)F-FDG PET scans performed during this 3-month period, 53% of the scans were visually interpreted as normal, 21% as mildly to moderately or incompletely affected, and 26% as severely affected according to the COVID hypometabolic pattern. On average, PET scans were performed at 10.9 months from symptom onset (± 4.8). Importantly, this specific hypometabolic pattern was similarly identified in the three nuclear medicine departments. Typical illustrative examples are provided to help nuclear physicians interpret long-COVID profiles. CONCLUSION: The proposed PET metabolic pattern is easily identified upon visual interpretation in clinical routine for approximately one half of patients with suspected neurological long COVID, requiring special consideration for frontobasal paramedian regions, the brainstem and the cerebellum, and certainly further adapted follow-up and medical care, while the second half of patients have normal brain PET metabolism on average 10.9 months from symptom onset.', '[TITLE]: Neurological, neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental complications of COVID-19 [AUTHORS]: Pantelis, Christos; Jayaram, Mahesh; Hannan, Anthony J; Wesselingh, Robb; Nithianantharajah, Jess; Wannan, Cassandra MJ; Syeda, Warda Taqdees; Choy, KH Christopher; Zantomio, Daniela; Christopoulos, Arthur; Velakoulis, Dennis; O’Brien, Terence J [JOURNAL]: Aust N Z J Psychiatry [ABSTRACT]: Although COVID-19 is predominantly a respiratory disease, it is known to affect multiple organ systems. In this article, we highlight the impact of SARS-CoV-2 (the coronavirus causing COVID-19) on the central nervous system as there is an urgent need to understand the longitudinal impacts of COVID-19 on brain function, behaviour and cognition. Furthermore, we address the possibility of intergenerational impacts of COVID-19 on the brain, potentially via both maternal and paternal routes. Evidence from preclinical models of earlier coronaviruses has shown direct viral infiltration across the blood–brain barrier and indirect secondary effects due to other organ pathology and inflammation. In the most severely ill patients with pneumonia requiring intensive care, there appears to be additional severe inflammatory response and associated thrombophilia with widespread organ damage, including the brain. Maternal viral (and other) infections during pregnancy can affect the offspring, with greater incidence of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, schizophrenia and epilepsy. Available reports suggest possible vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2, although longitudinal cohort studies of such offspring are needed. The impact of paternal infection on the offspring and intergenerational effects should also be considered. Research targeted at mechanistic insights into all aspects of pathogenesis, including neurological, neuropsychiatric and haematological systems alongside pulmonary pathology, will be critical in informing future therapeutic approaches. With these future challenges in mind, we highlight the importance of national and international collaborative efforts to gather the required clinical and preclinical data to effectively address the possible long-term sequelae of this global pandemic, particularly with respect to the brain and mental health.', '[TITLE]: Occurrence and transmission potential of asymptomatic and presymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections: A living systematic review and meta-analysis [AUTHORS]: Buitrago-Garcia, Diana; Egli-Gany, Dianne; Counotte, Michel J.; Hossmann, Stefanie; Imeri, Hira; Ipekci, Aziz Mert; Salanti, Georgia; Low, Nicola [JOURNAL]: PLoS Med [ABSTRACT]: BACKGROUND: There is disagreement about the level of asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We conducted a living systematic review and meta-analysis to address three questions: (1) Amongst people who become infected with SARS-CoV-2, what proportion does not experience symptoms at all during their infection? (2) Amongst people with SARS-CoV-2 infection who are asymptomatic when diagnosed, what proportion will develop symptoms later? (3) What proportion of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is accounted for by people who are either asymptomatic throughout infection or presymptomatic? METHODS AND FINDINGS: We searched PubMed, Embase, bioRxiv, and medRxiv using a database of SARS-CoV-2 literature that is updated daily, on 25 March 2020, 20 April 2020, and 10 June 2020. Studies of people with SARS-CoV-2 diagnosed by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) that documented follow-up and symptom status at the beginning and end of follow-up or modelling studies were included. One reviewer extracted data and a second verified the extraction, with disagreement resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Risk of bias in empirical studies was assessed with an adapted checklist for case series, and the relevance and credibility of modelling studies were assessed using a published checklist. We included a total of 94 studies. The overall estimate of the proportion of people who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 and remain asymptomatic throughout infection was 20% (95% confidence interval [CI] 17–25) with a prediction interval of 3%–67% in 79 studies that addressed this review question. There was some evidence that biases in the selection of participants influence the estimate. In seven studies of defined populations screened for SARS-CoV-2 and then followed, 31% (95% CI 26%–37%, prediction interval 24%–38%) remained asymptomatic. The proportion of people that is presymptomatic could not be summarised, owing to heterogeneity. The secondary attack rate was lower in contacts of people with asymptomatic infection than those with symptomatic infection (relative risk 0.35, 95% CI 0.10–1.27). Modelling studies fit to data found a higher proportion of all SARS-CoV-2 infections resulting from transmission from presymptomatic individuals than from asymptomatic individuals. Limitations of the review include that most included studies were not designed to estimate the proportion of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections and were at risk of selection biases; we did not consider the possible impact of false negative RT-PCR results, which would underestimate the proportion of asymptomatic infections; and the database does not include all sources. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this living systematic review suggest that most people who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 will not remain asymptomatic throughout the course of the infection. The contribution of presymptomatic and asymptomatic infections to overall SARS-CoV-2 transmission means that combination prevention measures, with enhanced hand hygiene, masks, testing tracing, and isolation strategies and social distancing, will continue to be needed.', '[TITLE]: Prolonged and extended impacts of SARS-CoV-2 on the olfactory neurocircuit [AUTHORS]: Kishimoto-Urata, Megumi; Urata, Shinji; Kagoya, Ryoji; Imamura, Fumiaki; Nagayama, Shin; Reyna, Rachel A.; Maruyama, Junki; Yamasoba, Tatsuya; Kondo, Kenji; Hasegawa-Ishii, Sanae; Paessler, Slobodan [JOURNAL]: Sci Rep [ABSTRACT]: The impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the olfactory pathway was studied over several time points using Syrian golden hamsters. We found an incomplete recovery of the olfactory sensory neurons, prolonged activation of glial cells in the olfactory bulb, and a decrease in the density of dendritic spines within the hippocampus. These data may be useful for elucidating the mechanism underlying long-lasting olfactory dysfunction and cognitive impairment as a post-acute COVID-19 syndrome.', '[TITLE]: Circadian rhythm disruption in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Implications for the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 [AUTHORS]: McCarthy, Michael J. [JOURNAL]: Brain Behav Immun Health [ABSTRACT]: Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a common and disabling disorder primarily characterized by persistent fatigue and exercise intolerance, with associated sleep disturbances, autonomic dysfunction, and cognitive problems. The causes of ME/CFS are not well understood but may coincide with immune and inflammatory responses following viral infections. During the current SARS-CoV2 coronavirus pandemic, ME/CFS has been increasingly reported to overlap with persistent “long COVID” symptoms, also called the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). Given the prominence of activity and sleep problems in ME/CFS, circadian rhythm disruption has been examined as a contributing factor in ME/CFS. While these studies of circadian rhythms have been pursued for decades, evidence linking circadian rhythms to ME/CFS remains inconclusive. A major limitation of older chronobiology studies of ME/CFS was the unavailability of modern molecular methods to study circadian rhythms and incomplete understanding of circadian rhythms outside the brain in peripheral organ systems. Major methodological and conceptual advancements in chronobiology have since been made. Over the same time, biomarker research in ME/CFS has progressed. Together, these new developments may justify renewed interest in circadian rhythm research in ME/CFS. Presently, we review ME/CFS from the perspective of circadian rhythms, covering both older and newer studies that make use of modern molecular methods. We focus on transforming growth factor beta (TGFB), a cytokine that has been previously associated with ME/CFS and has an important role in circadian rhythms, especially in peripheral cells. We propose that disrupted TGFB signaling in ME/CFS may play a role in disrupting physiological rhythms in sleep, activity, and cognition, leading to the insomnia, energy disturbances, cognition problems, depression, and autonomic dysfunction associated with ME/CFS. Since SARS-like coronavirus infections cause persistent changes in TGFB and previous coronavirus outbreaks have caused ME/CFS-like syndromes, chronobiological considerations may have immediate implications for understanding ME/CFS in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and possibly suggest new avenues for therapeutic interventions.', '[TITLE]: Frequent neurocognitive deficits after recovery from mild COVID-19 [AUTHORS]: Woo, Marcel S; Malsy, Jakob; Pöttgen, Jana; Zai, Susan Seddiq; Ufer, Friederike; Hadjilaou, Alexandros; Schmiedel, Stefan; Addo, Marylyn M; Gerloff, Christian; Heesen, Christoph; Schulze zur Wiesch, Julian; Friese, Manuel A [JOURNAL]: Brain Commun [ABSTRACT]: Neuropsychiatric complications associated with coronavirus disease 2019 caused by the Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) are increasingly appreciated. While most studies have focused on severely affected individuals during acute infection it remains unclear whether mild COVID-19 results in neurocognitive deficits in young patients. Here, we established a screening approach to detect cognitive deficiencies in post-COVID-19 patients. In this cross-sectional study, we recruited 18 mostly young patients 20 to 105 days (median 85 days) after recovery from mild to moderate disease who visited our outpatient clinic for post-COVID-19 care. Notably, 14 (78%) patients reported sustained mild cognitive deficits and performed worse in the Modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS-M) screening test for mild cognitive impairment compared to 10 age-matched healthy controls. While short-term memory, attention and concentration were particularly affected by COVID-19, screening results did not correlate with hospitalisation, treatment, viremia or acute inflammation. Additionally, TICS-M scores did not correlate with depressed mood or fatigue. In two severely affected patients we excluded structural or other inflammatory causes by magnetic resonance imaging, serum and cerebrospinal fluid analyses. Together, our results demonstrate that sustained subclinical cognitive impairments might be a common complication after recovery from COVID-19 in young adults, regardless of clinical course that were unmasked by our diagnostic approach.', '[TITLE]: Ribavirin antiviral combination therapy in COVID 19, a single-center experience [AUTHORS]: Singh, B. O.; Chikara, G.; Panda, P. K.; Bahurupi, Y. A.; Saha, S.; Pai, V. S. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Background COVID 19 infection has a similar clinical spectrum of disease presentation such as SARS and MERS in the past. These led to the assumption of the possibility to treat COVID 19 infection with antivirals which had been used to treat SARS and MERS. Methods A retrospective analysis was done on the data of SEV COVID Trial in symptomatic adult patients of COVID 19 infection with objectives to explore whether ribavirin antiviral combinations reduces the need of both noninvasive and invasive ventilators in treatment of COVID 19 infections. Results The patients were categorized as Cohort A consisting of 40 patients and Cohort B of 61 patients as Cohort A being the group of patients who received the standard therapy and Cohort B the group of patients who received the ribavirin combination therapy. Conclusion The study concluded that there was no statistically significant difference in regard to the need of noninvasive ventilation and invasive ventilation and also the development of multiorgan dysfunction in between the two Cohorts. Also, with progress of time, the proportion of patients with single organ dysfunctions in the two cohorts showed gradual recovery without any statistically significant differences.', \"[TITLE]: Social isolation during COVID‐19 lockdown impairs cognitive function [AUTHORS]: Ingram, Joanne; Hand, Christopher J.; Maciejewski, Greg [JOURNAL]: Appl Cogn Psychol [ABSTRACT]: Studies examining the effect of social isolation on cognitive function typically involve older adults and/or specialist groups (e.g., expeditions). We considered the effects of COVID‐19‐induced social isolation on cognitive function within a representative sample of the general population. We additionally considered how participants ‘shielding’ due to underlying health complications, or living alone, performed. We predicted that performance would be poorest under strictest, most‐isolating conditions. At five timepoints over 13 weeks, participants (N = 342; aged 18–72 years) completed online tasks measuring attention, memory, decision‐making, time‐estimation, and learning. Participants indicated their mood as ‘lockdown’ was eased. Performance typically improved as opportunities for social contact increased. Interactions between participant sub‐groups and timepoint demonstrated that performance was shaped by individuals' social isolation levels. Social isolation is linked to cognitive decline in the absence of ageing covariates. The impact of social isolation on cognitive function should be considered when implementing prolonged pandemic‐related restrictive conditions.\", \"[TITLE]: Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy for psychological distress in older adults without cognitive impairment living in nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic: A feasibility study [AUTHORS]: Ying, Yuchen; Ji, Yunxin; Kong, Fanqian; Chen, Qiqi; Lv, Yueer; Hou, Yanbin; Zhu, Lijie; Miao, Pingping; Yu, Libo; Li, Laiyou; Kuang, Wei; Jiang, Lingli; Zhu, Xiaozhuo; Liu, Xiaozhuang; Xu, Le; Mi, Yuwei; Lou, Zhongze; Ruan, Liemin [JOURNAL]: Internet Interv [ABSTRACT]: BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a detrimental effect on the mental health of older adults living in nursing homes. Very few studies have examined the effects of Internet-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (ICBT) on older adults living in nursing homes during the pandemic. We conducted a feasibility study using a single-group design, to explore the effectiveness of ICBT on psychological distress in 137 older adults (without cognitive impairment) from 8 nursing homes in 4 southeast cities in China, between January and March 2020. METHODS: Symptoms of depression, anxiety, general psychological distress, and functional disability were measured at baseline, post-treatment (5 weeks) and at a 1-month follow-up. Mixed-effects model was used to assess the effects of ICBT. RESULTS: Statistically significant changes with large effect sizes were observed from pre- to post-treatment on the PHQ-9 (p < .001, Cohen's d = 1.74), GAD-7 (p < .001, d = 1.71), GDS (p < .001, d = 1.30), K-10 (p < .001, d = 1.93), and SDS (p < .001, d = 2.03). Furthermore, improvements in treatment outcomes were sustained at 1-month follow-up, and high levels of adherence and satisfaction were indicated. CONCLUSION: ICBT was effective in reducing psychological distress in older adults without cognitive impairments living in nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, it could be applied in improving the mental health of this vulnerable group during the pandemic.\", '[TITLE]: 1-year outcomes in hospital survivors with COVID-19: a longitudinal cohort study [AUTHORS]: Huang, Lixue; Yao, Qun; Gu, Xiaoying; Wang, Qiongya; Ren, Lili; Wang, Yeming; Hu, Ping; Guo, Li; Liu, Min; Xu, Jiuyang; Zhang, Xueyang; Qu, Yali; Fan, Yanqing; Li, Xia; Li, Caihong; Yu, Ting; Xia, Jiaan; Wei, Ming; Chen, Li; Li, Yanping; Xiao, Fan; Liu, Dan; Wang, Jianwei; Wang, Xianguang; Cao, Bin [JOURNAL]: Lancet [ABSTRACT]: BACKGROUND: The full range of long-term health consequences of COVID-19 in patients who are discharged from hospital is largely unclear. The aim of our study was to comprehensively compare consequences between 6 months and 12 months after symptom onset among hospital survivors with COVID-19. METHODS: We undertook an ambidirectional cohort study of COVID-19 survivors who had been discharged from Jin Yin-tan Hospital (Wuhan, China) between Jan 7 and May 29, 2020. At 6-month and 12-month follow-up visit, survivors were interviewed with questionnaires on symptoms and health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and received a physical examination, a 6-min walking test, and laboratory tests. They were required to report their health-care use after discharge and work status at the 12-month visit. Survivors who had completed pulmonary function tests or had lung radiographic abnormality at 6 months were given the corresponding tests at 12 months. Non-COVID-19 participants (controls) matched for age, sex, and comorbidities were interviewed and completed questionnaires to assess prevalent symptoms and HRQoL. The primary outcomes were symptoms, modified British Medical Research Council (mMRC) score, HRQoL, and distance walked in 6 min (6MWD). Multivariable adjusted logistic regression models were used to evaluate the risk factors of 12-month outcomes. FINDINGS: 1276 COVID-19 survivors completed both visits. The median age of patients was 59·0 years (IQR 49·0–67·0) and 681 (53%) were men. The median follow-up time was 185·0 days (IQR 175·0–198·0) for the 6-month visit and 349·0 days (337·0–361·0) for the 12-month visit after symptom onset. The proportion of patients with at least one sequelae symptom decreased from 68% (831/1227) at 6 months to 49% (620/1272) at 12 months (p<0·0001). The proportion of patients with dyspnoea, characterised by mMRC score of 1 or more, slightly increased from 26% (313/1185) at 6-month visit to 30% (380/1271) at 12-month visit (p=0·014). Additionally, more patients had anxiety or depression at 12-month visit (26% [331/1271] at 12-month visit vs 23% [274/1187] at 6-month visit; p=0·015). No significant difference on 6MWD was observed between 6 months and 12 months. 88% (422/479) of patients who were employed before COVID-19 had returned to their original work at 12 months. Compared with men, women had an odds ratio of 1·43 (95% CI 1·04–1·96) for fatigue or muscle weakness, 2·00 (1·48–2·69) for anxiety or depression, and 2·97 (1·50–5·88) for diffusion impairment. Matched COVID-19 survivors at 12 months had more problems with mobility, pain or discomfort, and anxiety or depression, and had more prevalent symptoms than did controls. INTERPRETATION: Most COVID-19 survivors had a good physical and functional recovery during 1-year follow-up, and had returned to their original work and life. The health status in our cohort of COVID-19 survivors at 12 months was still lower than that in the control population.

The distribution of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) from bioinformatics evidence, the autopsy report for COVID-19 and the published study on sperm quality indicated COVID-19 could have a negative impact on male fertility. However, whether the negative impact of COVID-19 on male fertility is persistent remains unknown, which requires long-term follow-up investigation. Methods: Semen samples were collected from 36 male COVID-19 patients with a median recovery time of 177.5 days and 45 control subjects. Then, analysis of sperm quality and alterations of total sperm number with recovery time were performed. Results: There was no significant difference in semen parameters between male recovered patients and control subjects. And the comparisons of semen parameters between first follow-up and second follow-up revealed no significant difference. In addition, we explored the alterations of sperm count with recovery time. It showed that the group with recovery time of ≥120 and <150 days had a significantly lower total sperm number than controls while the other two groups with recovery time of ≥150 days displayed no significance with controls, and total sperm number showed a significant decline after a recovery time of 90 days and an improving trend after a recovery time of about 150 days. Conclusions: The sperm quality of COVID-19 recovered patients improved after a recovery time of nearly half a year, while the total sperm number showed an improvement after a recovery time of about 150 days. COVID-19 patients should pay close attention to the quality of semen, and might be considered to be given medical interventions if necessary within about two months after recovery, in order to improve the fertility of male patients as soon as possible.', '[TITLE]: Functional and cognitive outcomes after COVID-19 delirium [AUTHORS]: Mcloughlin, Benjamin C.; Miles, Amy; Webb, Thomas E.; Knopp, Paul; Eyres, Clodagh; Fabbri, Ambra; Humphries, Fiona; Davis, Daniel [JOURNAL]: Eur Geriatr Med [ABSTRACT]: PURPOSE: To ascertain delirium prevalence and outcomes in COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a point-prevalence study in a cohort of COVID-19 inpatients at University College Hospital. Delirium was defined by DSM-IV criteria. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 4 weeks; secondary outcomes were physical and cognitive function. RESULTS: In 71 patients (mean age 61, 75% men), 31 (42%) had delirium, of which only 12 (39%) had been recognised by the clinical team. At 4 weeks, 20 (28%) had died, 26 (36%) were interviewed by telephone and 21 (30%) remained as inpatients. Physical function was substantially worse in people after delirium − 50 out of 166 points (95% CI − 83 to − 17, p = 0.01). Mean cognitive scores at follow-up were similar and delirium was not associated with mortality in this sample. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that delirium is common, yet under-recognised. Delirium is associated with functional impairments in the medium term.

[JOURNAL]: CNS Drugs [ABSTRACT]: Preservation of cognitive function is an important outcome in oncology. Optimal patient management requires an understanding of cognitive effects of the disease and its treatment and an efficacious approach to assessment and management of cognitive dysfunction, including selection of treatments to minimize the risk of cognitive impairment. Awareness is increasing of the potentially detrimental effects of cancer-related cognitive dysfunction on functional independence and quality of life. Prostate cancer occurs most often in older men, who are more likely to develop cognitive dysfunction than younger individuals; this population may be particularly vulnerable to treatment-related cognitive disorders. Prompt identification of treatment-induced cognitive dysfunction is a crucial aspect of effective cancer management. We review the potential etiologies of cognitive decline in patients with prostate cancer, including the potential role of androgen receptor pathway inhibitors; commonly used tools for assessing cognitive function validated in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and adopted in non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer trials; and strategies for management of cognitive symptoms. Many methods are currently used to assess cognitive function. The prevalence and severity of cognitive dysfunction vary according to the instruments and criteria applied. Consensus on the definition of cognitive dysfunction and on the most appropriate approaches to quantify its extent and progression in patients treated for prostate cancer is lacking. Evidence-based guidance on the appropriate tools and time to assess cognitive function in patients with prostate cancer is required.', \"[TITLE]: What health preparations do international students make for their academic sojourn?

The direction of travel for much 'education first' educational tourism is from less- to more-economically developed countries, yet the existing literature tends to focus on the health-related expectations, precautions and behaviours of students travelling in the other direction. We explore the health implications of the international sojourn for students in UK higher education from various developing countries, and attendant risks such as the translocation of disease (a concern elevated by the COVID-19 pandemic). Drawing on, fusing and extending ideas from research on education and health mobilities, we examine students' experiences beyond the much-discussed first few weeks after arrival which is typically understood in terms of culture shock. Using narrative research and interviews with a purposive sample of students from ten countries/territories to establish their travel health preparations and perceptions, we reveal that they made extensive use of non-medical sources of advice including family and friends, the internet and study abroad agents. When they did become ill it was an isolating, distressing and frustrating experience due to delays in obtaining a doctor's appointment and the lack of social support away from home. Of some concern, these students perceived a low risk to traveling to and studying in the UK, and had given little thought to the possibility of inadvertently transmitting disease across borders. These findings will inform our understanding of international students' health, and have the potential to shape related policy and practice in origin and destination countries alike.\", '[TITLE]: A Longitudinal Study of COVID-19 Sequelae and Immunity: Baseline Findings.

Various pathophysiologic mechanisms have been implicated in the pathogenesis of postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). OBJECTIVE To characterize medical sequelae and persistent symptoms after recovery from COVID-19 in a cohort of disease survivors and controls. DESIGN Cohort study. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04411147). SETTING National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, Bethesda, Maryland. PARTICIPANTS Self-referred adults with laboratory-documented SARS-CoV-2 infection who were at least 6 weeks from symptom onset were enrolled regardless of presence of PASC. A control group comprised persons with no history of COVID-19 or serologic evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, recruited regardless of their current health status. Both groups were enrolled over the same period and from the same geographic area. MEASUREMENTS All participants had the same evaluations regardless of presence of symptoms, including physical examination, laboratory tests and questionnaires, cognitive function testing, and cardiopulmonary evaluation. A subset also underwent exploratory immunologic and virologic evaluations. RESULTS 189 persons with laboratory-documented COVID-19 (12% of whom were hospitalized during acute illness) and 120 antibody-negative control participants were enrolled. At enrollment, symptoms consistent with PASC were reported by 55% of the COVID-19 cohort and 13% of control participants. Increased risk for PASC was noted in women and those with a history of anxiety disorder. Participants with findings meeting the definition of PASC reported lower quality of life on standardized testing. Abnormal findings on physical examination and diagnostic testing were uncommon. Neutralizing antibody levels to spike protein were negative in 27% of the unvaccinated COVID-19 cohort and none of the vaccinated COVID-19 cohort. Exploratory studies found no evidence of persistent viral infection, autoimmunity, or abnormal immune activation in participants with PASC. LIMITATIONS Most participants with COVID-19 had mild to moderate acute illness that did not require hospitalization. The prevalence of reported PASC was likely overestimated in this cohort because persons with PASC may have been more motivated to enroll. The study did not capture PASC that resolved before enrollment. CONCLUSION A high burden of persistent symptoms was observed in persons after COVID-19. Extensive diagnostic evaluation revealed no specific cause of reported symptoms in most cases. Antibody levels were highly variable after COVID-19.

N.; Chew, J.; Lim, J. P.; Yew, S.; Yeo, A.; Lim, W. S. [JOURNAL]: J Frailty Aging [ABSTRACT]: BACKGROUND: Despite emerging evidence about the association between social frailty and cognitive impairment, little is known about the role of executive function in this interplay, and whether the coexistence of social frailty and cognitive impairment predisposes to adverse health outcomes in healthy community-dwelling older adults. OBJECTIVES: We aim to examine independent associations between social frailty with the MMSE and FAB, and to determine if having both social frailty and cognitive impairment is associated with worse health outcomes than either or neither condition. METHODS: We studied 229 cognitively intact and functionally independent community-dwelling older adults (mean age= 67.2±7.43). Outcome measures comprise physical activity; physical performance and frailty; geriatric syndromes; life space and quality of life. We compared Chinese Mini Mental State Examination (CMMSE) and Chinese Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) scores across the socially non-frail, socially pre-frail and socially frail. Participants were further recategorized into three subgroups (neither, either or both) based on presence of social frailty and cognitive impairment. Cognitive impairment was defined as a score below the educational adjusted cut-offs in either CMMSE or FAB. We performed logistic regression adjusted for significant covariates and mood to examine association with outcomes across the three subgroups. RESULTS: Compared with CMMSE, Chinese FAB scores significantly decreased across the social frailty spectrum (p<0.001), suggesting strong association between executive function with social frailty. We derived three subgroups relative to relationship with socially frailty and executive dysfunction: (i) Neither, N=140(61.1%), (ii) Either, N=79(34.5%), and (iii) Both, N=10(4.4%). Compared with neither or either subgroups, having both social frailty and executive dysfunction was associated with anorexia (OR=4.79, 95% CI= 1.04–22.02), near falls and falls (OR= 5.23, 95% CI= 1.10–24.90), lower life-space mobility (odds ratio, OR=9.80, 95% CI=2.07–46.31) and poorer quality of life (OR= 13.2, 95% CI= 2.38–73.4). CONCLUSION: Our results explicated the association of executive dysfunction with social frailty, and their synergistic relationship independent of mood with geriatric syndromes, decreased life space and poorer quality of life. In light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, the association between social frailty and executive dysfunction merits further study as a possible target for early intervention in relatively healthy older adults.', '[TITLE]: Cancer as a prospective sequela of long COVID‐19 [AUTHORS]: Saini, Geetanjali; Aneja, Ritu [JOURNAL]: Bioessays [ABSTRACT]: As the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) continues to surge worldwide, our knowledge of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is rapidly expanding. Although most COVID‐19 patients recover within weeks of symptom onset, some experience lingering symptoms that last for months (“long COVID‐19”). Early reports of COVID‐19 sequelae, including cardiovascular, pulmonary, and neurological conditions, have raised concerns about the long‐term effects of COVID‐19, especially in hard‐hit communities. It is becoming increasingly evident that cancer patients are more susceptible to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and are at a higher risk of severe COVID‐19 than the general population. Nevertheless, whether long COVID‐19 increases the risk of cancer in those with no prior malignancies, remains unclear. Given, the disproportionate impact of the disease on the African American community, yet another unanswered question is whether racial disparities are to be expected in COVID‐19 sequelae. Herein, we propose that long COVID‐19 may predispose recovered patients to cancer development and accelerate cancer progression. This hypothesis is based on growing evidence of the ability of SARS‐CoV‐2 to modulate oncogenic pathways, promote chronic low‐grade inflammation, and cause tissue damage. Comprehensive studies are urgently required to elucidate the effects of long COVID‐19 on cancer susceptibility.', '[TITLE]: Possible Sarcopenia and Impact of Dual-Task Exercise on Gait Speed, Handgrip Strength, Falls, and Perceived Health [AUTHORS]: Merchant, Reshma Aziz; Chan, Yiong Huak; Hui, Richard Jor Yeong; Lim, Jia Yi; Kwek, Sing Cheer; Seetharaman, Santhosh K.; Au, Lydia Shu Yi; Morley, John E. [JOURNAL]: Front Med (Lausanne) [ABSTRACT]: Background: Sarcopenia is defined as a progressive age-related loss in muscle mass and strength affecting physical performance. It is associated with many negative outcomes including falls, disability, cognitive decline, and mortality. Protein enriched diet and resistance training have shown to improve muscle strength and function but there is limited evidence on impact of dual-task exercise in possible sarcopenia. Objective: To evaluate impact of community-based dual-task exercise on muscle strength and physical function in possible sarcopenia defined by either slow gait (SG) or poor handgrip strength (HGS). The secondary aims include effect on cognition, frailty, falls, social isolation, and perceived health. Methods: Community-dwelling older adults ≥60 years old were recruited from screening program intended to identify seniors at risk, and invited to participate in dual-task exercise program called HAPPY (Healthy Aging Promotion Program for You). One hundred and eleven participants with possible sarcopenia completed 3 months follow-up. Questionnaire was administered on demographics, frailty, sarcopenia, falls, perceived health, social network, functional, and cognitive status. Physical performance included assessment of HGS, gait speed, and Short Physical Performance Battery test (SPPB). Results: The mean age of the Exercise group was 75.9 years old and 73.0% were women. The Exercise group had more female (73.0 vs. 47.5%), were older (75.9 vs. 72.5 years old), had higher prevalence of falls (32.4 vs. 15.0%), lower BMI (23.7 vs. 25.8), and education (4.0 vs. 7.2 years). The gait speed of the Exercise group increased significantly with significant reduction in the prevalence of SG and poor HGS. All components of SPPB as well as the total score increased significantly while the prevalence of pre-frailty and falls dropped by half. The risk of social isolation reduced by 25% with significant improvement in perceived health and cognition in the Exercise group. Significant impact on improvement gait speed and SPPB persisted after adjustment for baseline factors. Conclusion: Dual-task exercise program is effective in improving gait speed, SPPB score, and reducing the prevalence of poor HGS with significant improvement in perceived health, cognition, and reduction in falls and frailty. Future prospective randomized control trials are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of dual-task interventions in reversing sarcopenia.', '[TITLE]: Severity of respiratory failure and computed chest tomography in acute COVID-19 correlates with pulmonary function and respiratory symptoms after infection with SARS-CoV-2: an observational longitudinal study over 12 months [AUTHORS]: Steinbeis, F.; Thibeault, C.; Doellinger, F.; Ring, R. M.; Mittermaier, M.; Ruwwe-Gloesenkamp, C.; Alius, F.; Knape, P.; Meyer, H.-J.; Lippert, L. J.; Helbig, E. T.; Grund, D.; Temmesfeld-Wollbrueck, B.; Suttorp, N.; Sander, L. E.; Kurth, F.; Penzkofer, T.; Witzenrath, M.; Zoller, T. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Background Prospective and longitudinal data on pulmonary injury over one year after acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are sparse. Research question: With this study, we aim to investigate pulmonary outcome following SARS-CoV-2 infection including pulmonary function, computed chest tomography, respiratory symptoms and quality of life over 12 months. Study design and Methods 180 patients after acute COVID-19 were enrolled into a single-centre, prospective observational study and examined 6 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months after onset of COVID-19 symptoms. Chest CT-scans, pulmonary function and symptoms assessed by St. Georges Respiratory Questionnaire were used to evaluate objective and subjective respiratory limitations. Patients were stratified according to acute COVID-19 disease severity. Results Of 180 patients enrolled, 42/180 were not hospitalized during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, 29/180 were hospitalized without need for oxygen, 43/180 with need for low-flow and 24/180 with high-flow oxygen, 26/180 required invasive mechanical ventilation and 16/180 were treated with ECMO. After acute COVID-19, pulmonary restriction and reduced carbon monoxide diffusion capacity was associated with disease severity after the acute phase and improved over 12 months except for those requiring ECMO treatment. Patients with milder disease showed a predominant reduction of ventilated area instead of simple restriction. The CT score of lung involvement in the acute phase increased significantly with COVID-19 severity and was associated with restriction and reduction in diffusion capacity in follow-up. Respiratory symptoms improved for patients in higher severity groups during follow-up, but not for patients with mild initially disease. Interpretation Severity of respiratory failure during COVID-19 correlates with the degree of pulmonary function impairment and respiratory quality of life in the year after acute infection. Patients with mild vs. severe disease show different patterns of lung involvement and symptom resolution.', '[TITLE]: Long COVID: post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 with a cardiovascular focus [AUTHORS]: Raman, Betty; Bluemke, David A.; Lüscher, Thomas F.; Neubauer, Stefan [JOURNAL]: Eur Heart J [ABSTRACT]: Emerging as a new epidemic, long COVID or post-acute sequelae of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a condition characterized by the persistence of COVID-19 symptoms beyond 3 months, is anticipated to substantially alter the lives of millions of people globally. Cardiopulmonary symptoms including chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, and autonomic manifestations such as postural orthostatic tachycardia are common and associated with significant disability, heightened anxiety, and public awareness. A range of cardiovascular (CV) abnormalities has been reported among patients beyond the acute phase and include myocardial inflammation, myocardial infarction, right ventricular dysfunction, and arrhythmias. Pathophysiological mechanisms for delayed complications are still poorly understood, with a dissociation seen between ongoing symptoms and objective measures of cardiopulmonary health. COVID-19 is anticipated to alter the long-term trajectory of many chronic cardiac diseases which are abundant in those at risk of severe disease. In this review, we discuss the definition of long COVID and its epidemiology, with an emphasis on cardiopulmonary symptoms. We further review the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying acute and chronic CV injury, the range of post-acute CV sequelae, and impact of COVID-19 on multiorgan health. We propose a possible model for referral of post-COVID-19 patients to cardiac services and discuss future directions including research priorities and clinical trials that are currently underway to evaluate the efficacy of treatment strategies for long COVID and associated CV sequelae.', '[TITLE]: Breakthrough Symptomatic COVID-19 Infections Leading to Long Covid: Report from Long Covid Facebook Group Poll [AUTHORS]: Massey, D.; Berrent, D.; Krumholz, H. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Vaccines have been shown to be extremely effective in preventing COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths. However, a question remains whether vaccine breakthrough cases can still lead to Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC), also known as Long Covid. To address this question, the Survivor Corps group, a grassroots COVID-19 organization focused on patient support and research, posted a poll to its 169,900 members that asked about breakthrough cases, Long Covid, and hospitalizations. 1,949 people who self-report being fully vaccinated have responded to date. While robust data are needed in a larger, unbiased sample to extrapolate rates to the population, we analyzed the results of this public poll to determine what people were reporting regarding Long Covid after breakthrough infection and to prompt discussion of how breakthrough cases are measured. The poll was posted in the Survivor Corps Facebook group (~169,900 members). Of the 1,949 participants who responded to the poll, 44 reported a symptomatic breakthrough case and 24 of those reported that the case led to symptoms of Long Covid. 1 of these 24 cases was reported to have led to hospitalization in addition to Long Covid.', '[TITLE]: Pre-pandemic Cognitive Function and COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy: Cohort Study [AUTHORS]: David Batty, G.; Deary, Ian J.; Fawns-Ritchie, Chloe; Gale, Catharine R.; Altschul, Drew [JOURNAL]: Brain Behav Immun [ABSTRACT]: BACKGROUND: Whereas several predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy have been examined, the role of cognitive function following the widely publicised development of an inoculation is unknown. Accordingly, our objective was to test the association between scores from an array of cognitive function tests and self-reported vaccine hesitancy after the announcement of the successful testing of the Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine. METHODS: We used individual-level data from a pandemic-focused study (COVID Survey), a prospective cohort study nested within United Kingdom Understanding Society (Main Survey). In the week immediately following the announcement of successful testing of the first efficacious inoculation (November/December 2020), data on vaccine intentionality were collected in 11740 individuals (6702 women) aged 16-95. Pre-pandemic scores on general cognitive function, ascertained from a battery of six tests, were captured in 2011/12 wave of the Main Survey. Study members self-reported their intention to take up a vaccination for COVID-19. RESULTS: Of the study sample, 17.2% (N=1842) indicated they were hesitant about having the vaccine. After adjustment for age, sex, and ethnicity, study members with a lower baseline cognition score were markedly more likely to be vaccine hesitant (odds ratio per standard deviation lower score in cognition; 95% confidence interval: 1.76; 1.62, 1.90). Adjustment for mental and physical health plus household shielding status had no impact on these results, whereas controlling for educational attainment led to partial attenuation but the probability of hesitancy was still elevated (1.52; 1.37, 1.67). There was a linear association for vaccine hesitancy across the full range of cognition scores (p for trend: p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Erroneous social media reports might have complicated personal decision-making, leading to people with lower cognitive ability test scores being vaccine-hesitant. With people with lower cognition also experiencing higher rates of COVID-19 in studies conducted prior to vaccine distribution, these new findings are suggestive of a potential additional disease burden.', '[TITLE]: Clinical Characteristics, Activity Levels and Mental Health Problems in Children with Long COVID: A Survey of 510 Children [AUTHORS]: Buonsenso, Danilo Espuny Pujol Ferran Munblit Daniel McFarland Sammie Simpson Frances [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Background: The World Health Organization has recently recognized Long COVID, calling the international medical community to strengthen research and comprehensive care of patients with this condition. However, if Long COVID pertains to children as well is not yet clear. Methods An anonymous, online survey was developed by an organization of parents of children suffering from persisting symptoms since initial infection. Parents were asked to report signs and symptoms, physical activity and mental health issues. Only children with symptoms persisting for more than four weeks were included. Results 510 children were included (56.3% females) infected between January 2020 and January 2021. At their initial COVID-19 infection, 22 (4.3%) children were hospitalized. Overall, children had persisting COVID-19 for a mean of 8.2 months (SD 3.9). Most frequent symptoms were: Tiredness and weakness (444 patients, 87.1% of sample), Fatigue (410, 80.4%), Headache (401, 78.6%), Abdominal pain (387, 75.9%), Muscle and joint pain (309, 60.6%), Post-exertional malaise (274, 53.7%), rash (267, 52.4%). 484 (94.9%) children had had at least four symptoms. 129 (25.3%) children have suffered constant COVID-19 infection symptoms, 252 (49.4%) have had periods of apparent recovery and then symptoms returning, and 97 (19.0%) had a prolonged period of wellness followed by symptoms. Only 51 (10.0%) children have returned to previous levels of physical activity. Parents reported a significant prevalence of Neuropsychiatric symptoms. Conclusions Our study provides further evidence on Long COVID in children. Symptoms like fatigue, headache, muscle and joint pain, rashes and heart palpitations, and mental health issues like lack of concentration and short memory problems, were particularly frequent and confirm previous observations, suggesting that they may characterize this condition. A better comprehension of Long COVID is urgently needed..']}] \n",

[JOURNAL]: J Nutr Health Aging [ABSTRACT]: Oral health is a crucial but often neglected aspect of rehabilitation medicine. Approximately 71% of hospitalized rehabilitation patients and 91% of hospitalized acute care patients have impaired oral health. Poor oral condition in hospitalized patients can be attributed to factors such as age, physical dependency, cognitive decline, malnutrition, low skeletal muscle mass and strength, and multimorbidity. Another major factor is a lack of knowledge and interest in oral problems among health care workers. Recently, new concepts have been proposed, such as oral frailty, oral sarcopenia, and hospital-associated oral problems. Oral frailty, the accumulation of a slightly poor status of oral conditions and function, strongly predicts physical frailty, dysphagia, malnutrition, need for long-term care, and mortality in community-dwelling older adults. Oral sarcopenia refers to sarcopenia associated with oral conditions and function, although its definition has not yet been fully discussed. Hospital-associated oral problems are caused by disease, disease treatment, surgery, endotracheal intubation, poor self-care abilities, lack of care by medical staff, drugs, and iatrogenic factors during hospitalization. Furthermore, oral problems have negative impacts on rehabilitation outcomes, which include functional recovery, length of hospital stay, discharge home, and in-hospital mortality. Oral health management provided by dental hygienists improves not only oral status and function, swallowing function, and nutritional status but also activities of daily living, discharge home, and in-hospital mortality in post-acute rehabilitation. Oral rehabilitation, promotion, education, and medical-dental collaboration can be effective interventions for oral problems and therefore are necessary to improve rehabilitation outcomes.'], 'negative': ['[TITLE]: High expression of ACE2 receptor of 2019-nCoV on the epithelial cells of oral mucosa [AUTHORS]: Xu, Hao; Zhong, Liang; Deng, Jiaxin; Peng, Jiakuan; Dan, Hongxia; Zeng, Xin; Li, Taiwen; Chen, Qianming [JOURNAL]: Int J Oral Sci [ABSTRACT]: It has been reported that ACE2 is the main host cell receptor of 2019-nCoV and plays a crucial role in the entry of virus into the cell to cause the final infection. To investigate the potential route of 2019-nCov infection on the mucosa of oral cavity, bulk RNA-seq profiles from two public databases including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Functional Annotation of The Mammalian Genome Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (FANTOM5 CAGE) dataset were collected. RNA-seq profiling data of 13 organ types with para-carcinoma normal tissues from TCGA and 14 organ types with normal tissues from FANTOM5 CAGE were analyzed in order to explore and validate the expression of ACE2 on the mucosa of oral cavity. Further, single-cell transcriptomes from an independent data generated in-house were used to identify and confirm the ACE2-expressing cell composition and proportion in oral cavity. The results demonstrated that the ACE2 expressed on the mucosa of oral cavity. Interestingly, this receptor was highly enriched in epithelial cells of tongue. Preliminarily, those findings have explained the basic mechanism that the oral cavity is a potentially high risk for 2019-nCoV infectious susceptibility and provided a piece of evidence for the future prevention strategy in dental clinical practice as well as daily life.', '[TITLE]: Reducing transmission of COVID-19 using a continuous negative pressure operative field barrier during oral maxillofacial surgery [AUTHORS]: Gonzalez-Ciccarelli, Luis F.; Nilson, James; Oreadi, Daniel; Fakitsas, Dimitrios; Sekhar, Pavan; Quraishi, Sadeq A. [JOURNAL]: Oral Maxillofac Surg Cases [ABSTRACT]: Oral and maxillofacial surgery in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, presents a high risk of exposure and cross contamination to the operative room personnel.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This cross‐sectional study included 4647 individuals who answered a structured questionnaire containing demographic, medical and dental variables and self‐perceived breath odour. Variables associated with changes in self‐perceived breath odour, self‐perceived halitosis and changes in OHHs were assessed through multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Changes in self‐perceived breath odour were reported by 1572 individuals and were associated with smoking, systemic conditions, dry mouth, tongue coating, the period of face mask use and its interaction with prior thinking of having bad breath. Likewise, 645 individuals started to consider having bad breath. This was associated with the interaction between prior family/friends saying they have bad breath and period of face mask use. Changes in OHHs were strongly associated with changes in SPBO and starting to consider having bad breath. CONCLUSION: Changes in one's SPBO was associated with the wearing of face masks and was significant for changes in OHHs. Findings may be important to guide comprehensive preventive and therapeutic strategies in relation to oral health care.\", '[TITLE]: Quantitative Salivary Proteomic Differences in Oral Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease [AUTHORS]: Bassim, Carol W; Ambatipudi, Kiran S.; Mays, Jacqueline W.; Edwards, Dean A.; Swatkoski, Stephan; Fassil, Helen; Baird, Kristin; Gucek, Marjan; Melvin, James E.; Pavletic, Steven Z. [JOURNAL]: J Clin Immunol [ABSTRACT]: PURPOSE: Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is a severe immunological complication that occurs after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Although oral cGVHD occurs in >25 % of cGVHD patients and leads to decreased quality of life, its etiology is poorly understood. The present retrospective cross-sectional analysis of oral cGVHD patients sought to (1) test the feasibility of liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to identify protein biomarkers of oral cGVHD and (2) to gain a clearer understanding of salivary proteins impacted by oral cGVHD. METHODS: Using unstimulated whole saliva, we compared pooled saliva from five patients with a diagnosis of moderate or severe oral cGVHD, with a gender-and age- matched pool of five cGVHD patients with no oral mucosal findings. LC-MS/MS was used to identify salivary proteins, followed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Selected mass spectrometric findings, including lactotransferrin, lactoperoxidase, and albumin, were confirmed by targeted label-free quantification. RESULTS: LC-MS/MS led to confident identification of 180 proteins. Of these proteins, 102 changed in abundance at least 2 fold, including 12 proteins identified only in the No oral cGVHD group. Downregulation of ~0.4 fold was confirmed for both lactotransferrin and lactoperoxidase in Oral cGVHD saliva using targeted label-free quantification. IPA analysis implicated pathways involved in cellular metabolism and immunoregulation. CONCLUSIONS: Reduction of salivary lactoperoxidase, lactotransferrin, and several cysteine proteinase inhibitor family proteins suggests impaired oral antimicrobial host immunity in cGVHD patients. This shotgun proteomic analysis of oral cGVHD saliva using targeted label-free quantification of select proteins supports the use of mass spectrometry for future validation in a large patient population as noninvasive tests for screening, early detection, and monitoring of cGVHD.

Preventing HCWs from getting infected is a priority to maintain healthcare services. The therapeutic and preventive role of ivermectin in COVID-19 is being investigated. Based on promising results of in vitro studies of oral ivermectin, this study was conducted with the aim to demonstrate the prophylactic role of oral ivermectin in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infectionamong HCWs at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Bhubaneswar. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted at AIIMS Bhubaneswar, which provides both COVID and Non-COVID care since March 2020. All employees and students of the institute who provided written informed consent participated in the study.Uptake of two-doses of oral ivermectin (300 μg/kg at a gap of 72 hours) was considered as exposure. The primary outcome of the study was COVID-19 infection in the following month of ivermectin consumption diagnosed by RTPCR as per Government of India testing criteria guidelines.The log-binomial model was used to estimate adjusted relative risk, and the Kaplan-Meier failure plot was used to estimate the probability of COVID-19 infection with follow-up time. Results: Of 3892 employees, 3532 (90.8%) participated in the study. The ivermectin uptake was 62.5% and 5.3% for two-doses and single-dose, respectively. Participants who took ivermectin prophylaxis had a lower risk of getting symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection(6% vs 15%). HCWs who had taken two-doses of oral ivermectin have a significantly lower risk of contracting COVID-19 disease during the following month (ARR 0.17;95% CI, 0.12-0.23). Females had a lower risk of contracting COVID-19 than males (ARR 0.70 95% CI, 0.52-0.93). The absolute risk reduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 9.7%. Only 1.8% of the participants reported adverse events, which were mild and self-limiting. Conclusion: and relevance Two-doses of oral ivermectin (300 μg/kg given 72 hours apart) as chemoprophylaxis among HCWs reduces the risk of COVID-19 infection by 83% in the following month.

Methods An open-label parallel randomized controlled trial was performed among healthy migrant workers quarantined in a large multi-storey dormitory in Singapore. Forty clusters (each defined as individual floors of the dormitory) were randomly assigned to receive a 42-day prophylaxis regimen of either oral hydroxychloroquine (400 mg once, followed by 200 mg/day), oral ivermectin (12 mg once), povidone-iodine throat spray (3 times/day, 270 µg/day), oral zinc (80 mg/day)/vitamin C (500 mg/day) combination, or oral vitamin C, 500 mg/day. The primary outcome was laboratory evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection as shown by either: (1) a positive serologic test for SARS-CoV-2 antibody on day 42, or (2) a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 at any time between baseline and day 42. Results A total of 3,037 asymptomatic participants (mean age, 33.0 years; all men) who were seronegative to SARS-CoV-2 at baseline were included in the primary analysis. Follow-up was nearly complete (99.6%). Compared with vitamin C, significant absolute risk reductions (%, 98.75% confidence interval) were observed for oral hydroxychloroquine (21%, 2–42%) and povidone-iodine throat spray (24%, 7–39%). No statistically significant differences were observed with oral zinc/vitamin C combination (23%, –5 to +41%) and ivermectin (5%, –10 to +22%). Interruptions due to side effects were highest among participants who received zinc/vitamin C combination (6.9%), followed by vitamin C (4.7%), povidone-iodine (2.0%) and hydroxychloroquine (0.7%). Conclusions Chemoprophylaxis with either oral hydroxychloroquine or povidone-iodine throat spray was superior to oral vitamin C in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection in young and healthy men.

METHODS: In this study, we demonstrate that an oral, adenovirus-based vaccine candidate protects against SARS-CoV-2 in a Syrian hamster challenge model. RESULTS: Hamsters administered 2 doses of VXA-CoV2-1 showed a reduction in weight loss and lung pathology and had completely eliminated infectious virus 5 days postchallenge. Oral immunization induced antispike immunoglobulin G, and neutralizing antibodies were induced upon oral immunization with the sera, demonstrating neutralizing activity. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these data demonstrate the ability of oral vaccine candidate VXA-CoV2-1 to provide protection against SARS-CoV-2 disease.', '[TITLE]: Therapeutic efficacy of an oral nucleoside analog of remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in mice.

[JOURNAL]: bioRxiv [ABSTRACT]: The COVID-19 pandemic remains uncontrolled despite the rapid rollout of safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, underscoring the need to develop highly effective antivirals. In the setting of waning immunity from infection and vaccination, breakthrough infections are becoming increasingly common and treatment options remain limited. Additionally, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern with their potential to escape therapeutic monoclonal antibodies emphasizes the need to develop second-generation oral antivirals targeting highly conserved viral proteins that can be rapidly deployed to outpatients. Here, we demonstrate the in vitro antiviral activity and in vivo therapeutic efficacy of GS-621763, an orally bioavailable prodrug of GS-441524, the parental nucleoside of remdesivir, which targets the highly conserved RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. GS-621763 exhibited significant antiviral activity in lung cell lines and two different human primary lung cell culture systems. The dose-proportional pharmacokinetic profile observed after oral administration of GS-621763 translated to dose-dependent antiviral activity in mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. Therapeutic GS-621763 significantly reduced viral load, lung pathology, and improved pulmonary function in COVID-19 mouse model. A direct comparison of GS-621763 with molnupiravir, an oral nucleoside analog antiviral currently in human clinical trial, proved both drugs to be similarly efficacious. These data demonstrate that therapy with oral prodrugs of remdesivir can significantly improve outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 infected mice. Thus, GS-621763 supports the exploration of GS-441524 oral prodrugs for the treatment of COVID-19 in humans.', '[TITLE]: Prophylactic Role of Ivermectin in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection Among Healthcare Workers [AUTHORS]: Behera, Priyamadhaba; Patro, Binod K; Padhy, Biswa M; Mohapatra, Prasanta R; Bal, Shakti K; Chandanshive, Pradnya D; Mohanty, Rashmi R; Ravikumar, SR; Singh, Arvind; Singh, Sudipta R; Pentapati, Siva Santosh Kumar; Nair, Jyolsna; Batmanbane, Gitanjali [JOURNAL]: Cureus [ABSTRACT]: Introduction Healthcare workers (HCWs) are vulnerable to getting infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

This is a site of rich exposure to antigens and commensals, and a tissue susceptible to one of the most prevalent human inflammatory diseases, periodontitis. To aid in understanding tissue-specific pathophysiology, we compile a single-cell transcriptome atlas of human oral mucosa in healthy individuals and patients with periodontitis. We uncover the complex cellular landscape of oral mucosal tissues and identify epithelial and stromal cell populations with inflammatory signatures that promote antimicrobial defenses and neutrophil recruitment. Our findings link exaggerated stromal cell responsiveness with enhanced neutrophil and leukocyte infiltration in periodontitis. Our work provides a resource characterizing the role of tissue stroma in regulating mucosal tissue homeostasis and disease pathogenesis.', '[TITLE]: Antiviral mouthwashes: possible benefit for COVID-19 with evidence-based approach [AUTHORS]: Moosavi, Mahdieh-Sadat; Aminishakib, Pouyan; Ansari, Maryam [JOURNAL]: Journal of oral microbiology [ABSTRACT]: BACKGROUND: The outbreak, and pandemic of COVID-19 causing widespread concerns in all health systems of countries. Virus-carrying aerosols can penetrate the healthy human body and lungs, resulting in rapid transmission. For the first time, in this evidence-based article, the effects of different types of mouthwashes to reduce the viral load were investigated. Also, another aim of this essay is a reduction in viral load in patients with COVID-19 and prevention developing ventilator-associated pneumonia in critically ill patients. METHODS: Related databases were comprehensively searched for relevant studies. The present study was performed according to the preferred cases for standard systematic reviews (PRISMA). RESULTS: Five original studies in which the subject matter was directly evaluated were included. Different types of mouthwashes and viruses were investigated in this study. CONCLUSIONS: The antiviral mouthwashes play a certainly important role in reducing the viral load of the salivary virus. In the present study, this importance could be proved in two different aspects, that is, the use of mouthwash before dental procedures to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus to the dental team and the use of this mouthwash in COVID-19 patients to help improve systemic problems associated with oral microbial flora.', '[TITLE]: SARS-CoV-2 infection of the oral cavity and saliva.

To address this, we generated and analyzed two single-cell RNA sequencing datasets of the human minor salivary glands and gingiva (9 samples, 13,824 cells), identifying 50 cell clusters. Using integrated cell normalization and annotation, we classified 34 unique cell subpopulations between glands and gingiva. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral entry factors such as ACE2 and TMPRSS members were broadly enriched in epithelial cells of the glands and oral mucosae. Using orthogonal RNA and protein expression assessments, we confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the glands and mucosae. Saliva from SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals harbored epithelial cells exhibiting ACE2 and TMPRSS expression and sustained SARS-CoV-2 infection. Acellular and cellular salivary fractions from asymptomatic individuals were found to transmit SARS-CoV-2 ex vivo. Matched nasopharyngeal and saliva samples displayed distinct viral shedding dynamics, and salivary viral burden correlated with COVID-19 symptoms, including taste loss. Upon recovery, this asymptomatic cohort exhibited sustained salivary IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Collectively, these data show that the oral cavity is an important site for SARS-CoV-2 infection and implicate saliva as a potential route of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.', '[TITLE]: Vagus nerve neuropathy related to SARS COV-2 infection [AUTHORS]: Moyano A, Jairo R; Mejía Torres, Sara; Espinosa, Jonathan [JOURNAL]: IDCases [ABSTRACT]: A 38-year-old woman with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection developed dysphagia to both solids and liquids.

Since there are currently no coded therapies or guidelines for treatment of COVID-19, this study aimed to evaluate the possible role of a specific oral bacteriotherapy as complementary therapeutic strategy to avoid the progression of COVID-19. Methods: We provide a report of 70 patients positive for COVID-19, hospitalized between March 9th and April 4th, 2020. All the patients had fever, required non-invasive oxygen therapy and presented a CT lung involvement on imaging more than 50%. Forty-two patients received hydroxychloroquine, antibiotics, and tocilizumab, alone or in combination. A second group of 28 subjects received the same therapy added with oral bacteriotherapy, using a multistrain formulation. Results: The two cohorts of patients were comparable for age, sex, laboratory values, concomitant pathologies, and the modality of oxygen support. Within 72 h, nearly all patients treated with bacteriotherapy showed remission of diarrhea and other symptoms as compared to less than half of the not supplemented group. The estimated risk of developing respiratory failure was eight-fold lower in patients receiving oral bacteriotherapy. Both the prevalence of patients transferred to ICU and mortality were higher among the patients not treated with oral bacteriotherapy. Conclusions: A specific bacterial formulation showed a significant ameliorating impact on the clinical conditions of patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results also stress the importance of the gut-lung axis in controlling the COVID-19 disease.\", '[TITLE]: Orally delivered MK-4482 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in the Syrian hamster model [AUTHORS]: Rosenke, Kyle; Hansen, Frederick; Schwarz, Benjamin; Feldmann, Friederike; Haddock, Elaine; Rosenke, Rebecca; Barbian, Kent; Meade-White, Kimberly; Okumura, Atsushi; Leventhal, Shanna; Hawman, David W.; Ricotta, Emily; Bosio, Catharine M.; Martens, Craig; Saturday, Greg; Feldmann, Heinz; Jarvis, Michael A. [JOURNAL]: Nat Commun [ABSTRACT]: The COVID-19 pandemic progresses unabated in many regions of the world. An effective antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 that could be administered orally for use following high-risk exposure would be of substantial benefit in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Herein, we show that MK-4482, an orally administered nucleoside analog, inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in the Syrian hamster model. The inhibitory effect of MK-4482 on SARS-CoV-2 replication is observed in animals when the drug is administered either beginning 12 h before or 12 h following infection in a high-risk exposure model. These data support the potential utility of MK-4482 to control SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans following high-risk exposure as well as for treatment of COVID-19 patients.', '[TITLE]: A thermostable oral SARS-CoV-2 vaccine induces mucosal and protective immunity [AUTHORS]: Bellier, Bertrand; Saura, Alicia; Luján, Lucas A.; Molina, Cecilia R.; Lujan, Hugo D.; Klatzmann, David [JOURNAL]: bioRxiv [ABSTRACT]: An ideal protective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 should not only be effective in preventing disease, but also in preventing virus transmission. It should also be well accepted by the population and have a simple logistic chain. To fulfill these criteria, we developed a thermostable, orally administered vaccine that can induce a robust mucosal neutralizing immune response. We used our platform based on retrovirus-derived enveloped virus-like particles (e-VLPs) harnessed with variable surface proteins (VSPs) from the intestinal parasite Giardia lamblia, affording them resistance to degradation and the triggering of robust mucosal cellular and antibody immune responses after oral administration. We made e-VLPs expressing various forms of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S), with or without membrane protein (M) expression. We found that prime-boost administration of VSP-decorated e-VLPs expressing a pre-fusion stabilized form of S and M triggers robust mucosal responses against SARS-CoV-2 in mice and hamsters, which translate into complete protection from a viral challenge. Moreover, they dramatically boosted the IgA mucosal response of intramuscularly injected vaccines. We conclude that our thermostable orally administered e-VLP vaccine could be a valuable addition to the current arsenal against SARS-CoV-2, in a stand-alone prime-boost vaccination strategy or as a boost for existing vaccines.', '[TITLE]: The SARS-CoV2 envelope differs from host cells, exposes pro-coagulant lipids, and is disrupted in vivo by oral rinses [AUTHORS]: Saud, Zack; Tyrrell, Victoria J.; Zaragkoulias, Andreas; Protty, Majd B.; Statkute, Evelina; Rubina, Anzelika; Bentley, Kirsten; White, Daniel A.; Rodrigues, Patricia Dos Santos; Murphy, Robert C.; Köfeler, Harald; Griffiths, William J.; Alvarez-Jarreta, Jorge; Brown, Richard William; Newcombe, Robert G.; Heyman, James; Pritchard, Manon; Mcleod, Robert WJ.; Arya, Arvind; Lynch, Ceri-Ann; Owens, David; Jenkins, P Vince; Buurma, Niklaas J.; O’Donnell, Valerie B.; Thomas, David W.; Stanton, Richard J. [JOURNAL]: J Lipid Res [ABSTRACT]: The lipid envelope of SARS-CoV-2 is an essential component of the virus; however, its molecular composition is undetermined. Addressing this knowledge gap could support the design of anti-viral agents, as well as further our understanding of viral-host protein interactions, infectivity, pathogenicity, and innate immune system clearance. Using lipidomics analyses, we revealed that the virus envelope comprised mainly phospholipids (PL), with little cholesterol or sphingolipids, indicating significant differences from the composition of host membranes. Unlike cellular membranes, procoagulant aminophospholipids were present on the external side of the viral envelope at levels exceeding those on activated platelets. As a result, virions directly promoted blood coagulation. To investigate whether these differences could enable selective targeting of the viral envelope in vivo, we tested whether oral rinses containing lipid-disrupting chemicals could reduce viral infectivity. Products containing PL-disrupting surfactants (such as cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC)) met European virucidal standards in vitro; however, components that altered the critical micelle concentration reduced efficacy, and products containing essential oils, PVP-I, or Chlorhexidine were ineffective. This result was recapitulated in vivo, where a 30-second oral rinse with CPC mouthwash eliminated live virus in the oral cavity of COVID-19 patients for at least one hour, while PVP-Iodine and saline mouthwashes were found ineffective. We conclude the SARS-CoV-2 lipid envelope (i) is distinct from the host plasma membrane, which may enable design of selective anti-viral approaches; (ii) contains exposed PE and PS, which may influence thrombosis, pathogenicity, and inflammation; and (iii) can be selectively targeted in vivo by specific oral rinses.', '[TITLE]: Detection of persistent SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in oral mucosal fluid and upper respiratory tract specimens following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination [AUTHORS]: Mades, A.; Chellamuthu, P.; Lopez, L.; Kojima, N.; MacMullan, M. A.; Denny, N.; Angel, A. N.; Casian, J.; Brobeck, M.; Nirema, N.; Klausner, J. D.; Turner, F. E.; Slepnev, V. I.; Ibrayeva, A. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Previous studies have shown that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective at preventing SAR-CoV-2 infection by generating an immune response, which in part produces SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in serum. In this study, we hypothesized that COVID-19 vaccines may elicit production of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in the upper respiratory tract, such as in oral and nasal mucosal fluid. To test that hypothesis, we enrolled 114 participants within 3-7 days of receiving the first dose of the Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccine and collected oral mucosal fluid samples on days 5, 10, 15, and 20 after each vaccine dose. Of participants naive to SARS-CoV-2 (n = 89), 79 (85.4%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies by time point 2 (10 days +/-2 days after first vaccine dose), and 100% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG by time point 3 (15 days +/- 2 days after first vaccine dose). Additionally, we collected paired oral mucosal fluid and anterior nares samples from 10 participants who had received both vaccine doses. We found that participants had an average SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody concentration of 2496.0 +/- 2698.0ng/mL in nasal mucosal fluid versus 153.4 +/- 141.0ng/mL in oral mucosal fluid. Here, we demonstrate detection and longitudinal persistence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in upper respiratory tract specimens following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. A high concentration of IgG targeting viral spike protein in the upper respiratory system may play an unexplored role in the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection and deserves further investigation.', '[TITLE]: An orally available Mpro inhibitor is effective against wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and variants including Omicron [AUTHORS]: Quan, Bao-Xue; Shuai, Huiping; Xia, An-Jie; Hou, Yuxin; Zeng, Rui; Liu, Xin-Lei; Lin, Gui-Feng; Qiao, Jing-Xin; Li, Wen-Pei; Wang, Fa-Lu; Wang, Kai; Zhou, Ren-Jie; Yuen, Terrence Tsz-Tai; Chen, Ming-Xin; Yoon, Chaemin; Wu, Ming; Zhang, Shi-Yu; Huang, Chong; Wang, Yi-Fei; Yang, Wei; Tian, Chenyu; Li, Wei-Min; Wei, Yu-Quan; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Lei, Jian; Chu, Hin; Yang, Shengyong [JOURNAL]: Nat Microbiol [ABSTRACT]: Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to cause waves of new infections globally. Developing effective antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants is an urgent task. The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is an attractive drug target because of its central role in viral replication and its conservation among variants. We herein report a series of potent α-ketoamide-containing Mpro inhibitors obtained using the Ugi four-component reaction. The prioritized compound, Y180, showed an IC50 of 8.1 nM against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and had oral bioavailability of 92.9%, 31.9% and 85.7% in mice, rats and dogs, respectively. Y180 protected against wild-type SARS-CoV-2, B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.617.1 (Kappa) and P.3 (Theta), with EC50 of 11.4, 20.3, 34.4 and 23.7 nM, respectively. Oral treatment with Y180 displayed a remarkable antiviral potency and substantially ameliorated the virus-induced tissue damage in both nasal turbinate and lung of B.1.1.7-infected K18-human ACE2 (K18-hACE2) transgenic mice. Therapeutic treatment with Y180 improved the survival of mice from 0 to 44.4% (P = 0.0086) upon B.1.617.1 infection in the lethal infection model. Importantly, Y180 was also highly effective against the B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant both in vitro and in vivo. Overall, our study provides a promising lead compound for oral drug development against SARS-CoV-2.', '[TITLE]: POTENTIAL USE OF IVERMECTIN FOR THE TREATMENT AND PROPHYLAXIS OF SARS-CoV-2 INFECTION [AUTHORS]: Cobos-Campos, R; Apiñaniz, A; Parraza, N; Cordero, J; García, S; Orruño, E [JOURNAL]: Curr Res Transl Med [ABSTRACT]: PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Currently no treatment has been proven to be efficacious for patients with early symptoms of COVID-19. Although most patients present mild or moderate symptoms, up to 5-10% may have a poor disease progression, so there is an urgent need for effective drugs, which can be administered even before the onset of severe symptoms, i.e. when the course of the disease is modifiable. Recently, promising results of several studies on oral ivermectin have been published, which has prompted us to conduct the present review of the scientific literature. METHODS: A narrative review has been carried out, focusing on the following four main topics: a) short-term efficacy in the treatment of the disease, b) long-term efficacy in the treatment of patients with post-acute symptoms of COVID-19, c) efficacy in the prophylaxis of the disease, and c) safety of ivermectin. RESULTS: The reviewed literature suggests that there seems to be sufficient evidence about the safety of oral ivermectin, as well as the efficacy of the drug in the early-treatment and the prophylaxis of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: In the view of the available evidence, the Frontline COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance (FLCCC) recommends the use of oral ivermectin for both prophylaxis and early-treatment of COVID-19. Further well-designed studies should be conducted in order to explore the efficacy and safety of invermectin at low and high doses, following different dosing schedules, in both, the short and long-term treatment.', '[TITLE]: Effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on adversity in individuals receiving anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation: A nationally representative administrative health claims analysis [AUTHORS]: Hernandez, Inmaculada; Gabriel, Nico; He, Meiqi; Guo, Jingchuan; Tadrous, Mina; Suda, Katie J.; Magnani, Jared W. [JOURNAL]: Am Heart J Plus [ABSTRACT]: BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is strongly associated with clinical adversity, including increased hospitalization and bleeding and stroke events. We examined the effect of the SARS-2 Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on such events in individuals with AF receiving oral anticoagulation. METHODS: We employed medical and pharmacy claims spanning 2018–2020 from a nationally representative U.S. database (IQVIA Longitudinal Prescription, Medical Claims, and Institutional Claims). We selected individuals receiving oral anticoagulation in 2018 for AF and followed them from 1/1/2019–7/8/2020 for clinical events. We constructed interrupted time-series analyses across 30-day intervals with Poisson regression models to determine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinical events. RESULTS: The dataset included 1,439,145 individuals (half with age ≥75 years; 47.6% women) receiving oral anticoagulation. We determined a 19% decrease in emergency room visits following the pandemic declaration and 8% decrease in inpatient admissions. In contrast admissions for stroke and bleeding were not affected by the declaration of the pandemic. DISCUSSION: These results describe the temporal effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinical adversity – hospitalizations, strokes, and bleeding events – in individuals receiving oral anticoagulation for AF. Our analysis quantifies the decrease in clinical adversity accompanying COVID-19 in a large, highly representative U.S. health claims database.', '[TITLE]: Short- term effect of probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri consumption on the salivary microbiome profile of subjects undergoing orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances [AUTHORS]: Widyarman, Armelia Sari; Udawatte, Nadeeka S.; Roeslan, Moehamad Orliando; Rizal, Muhammad Ihsan; Richi, Mario; Kusnoto, Joko; Seneviratne, Chaminda Jayampath [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: OBJECTIVE: This prospective clinical study aim was to analyze the effect of the probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri Prodentis lozenges on salivary microbiome of subjects wearing fixed orthodontic appliances. METHODS: Saliva samples were collected prior to consumption and 14th-day post probiotic lozenges consumption (n=40, age 18–23). Oral hygiene index-score (OHI-S) and papilla bleeding index (PBI) were recorded. The salivary microbiome was profiled by next-generation sequencing using the V3-V4 region of 16S-rRNA. Microbial composition, diversity and taxonomic biomarkers were analysed in comparison to probiotic intervention and the clinical characteristics of the cohort using standard bioinformatics tools. RESULTS: The diversity and bacterial community structures did not change significantly in salivary microbiome of periodontally healthy subjects during short-term probiotic intervention. Probiotic consumption correlated with reduction of OHI and PBI scores (50% reduction of scores, P<0.001). The reduction of clinical indices was evident in conjunction with significantly reduced abundance of oral pathogens, such as Porphyromonas pasteri, Treponema sp., Fretibacterium fastidiosum, Kingella oralis and Propionibacterium acnes. CONCLUSION: Short-term probiotic intervention helped maintaining good oral health in patients undergoing fixed orthodontic therapy. Although overall oral microbiome structure remained largely unchanged, a significant alteration in the abundance of health and disease-associated species highlighted the beneficial effect of probiotic.', '[TITLE]: A case series of vaccine‐induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia in a London teaching hospital [AUTHORS]: Watts, Isabella; Smith, David; Mounter, Sarah; Baker, Emma H.; Hitchings, Andrew W.; Gill, Dipender [JOURNAL]: Br J Clin Pharmacol [ABSTRACT]: The ChAdOx1 nCoV‐19 vaccine has been associated with increased risk of thrombosis. Understanding of the management of these rare events is evolving, and currently recommended treatments include human normal immunoglobulin and nonheparin anticoagulation such as direct oral anticoagulants. Our report describes three consecutive patients presenting to a London teaching hospital with vaccine‐induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT), also referred to as vaccine‐induced prothrombotic immune thrombocytopenia. The patients ranged in age from 40 to 54 years and two had no known previous medical comorbidities. Two patients had cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and one had a deep vein thrombosis. Two were treated with anticoagulation, one with oral rivaroxaban and the other with an intravenous argotraban infusion that was later converted to oral apixaban. One patient received three doses of human normal immunoglobulin and 5 days of therapeutic plasma exchange. This case series may be used to improve understanding of the clinical course and management of VITT.', '[TITLE]: Integrated Single-Cell Atlases Reveal an Oral SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Transmission Axis [AUTHORS]: Byrd, K.

D.; Chertow, D.; NIHCOVID-19, A [JOURNAL]: medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences [ABSTRACT]: Despite signs of infection, the involvement of the oral cavity in COVID-19 is poorly understood. To address this, single-cell RNA sequencing datasets were integrated from human minor salivary glands and gingiva to identify 11 epithelial, 7 mesenchymal, and 15 immune cell clusters. Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry factor expression showed enrichment in epithelia including the ducts and acini of the salivary glands and the suprabasal cells of the mucosae. COVID-19 autopsy tissues confirmed in vivo SARS CoV-2 infection in the salivary glands and mucosa. Saliva from SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals harbored epithelial cells exhibiting ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Matched nasopharyngeal and saliva samples found distinct viral shedding dynamics and viral burden in saliva correlated with COVID-19 symptoms including taste loss. Upon recovery, this cohort exhibited salivary antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Collectively, the oral cavity represents a robust site for COVID-19 infection andimplicates saliva in viral transmission.', '[TITLE]: An orally bioavailable broad-spectrum antiviral inhibits SARS-CoV-2 and multiple endemic, epidemic and bat coronavirus [AUTHORS]: Sheahan, Timothy P.; Sims, Amy C.; Zhou, Shuntai; Graham, Rachel L.; Hill, Collin S.; Leist, Sarah R.; Schäfer, Alexandra; Dinnon, Kenneth H.; Montgomery, Stephanie A.; Agostini, Maria L.; Pruijssers, Andrea J.; Chapell, James D.; Brown, Ariane J.; Bluemling, Gregory R.; Natchus, Michael G.; Saindane, Manohar; Kolykhalov, Alexander A.; Painter, George; Harcourt, Jennifer; Tamin, Azaibi; Thornburg, Natalie J.; Swanstrom, Ronald; Denison, Mark R.; Baric, Ralph S. [JOURNAL]: bioRxiv [ABSTRACT]: Coronaviruses (CoVs) traffic frequently between species resulting in novel disease outbreaks, most recently exemplified by the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2. Herein, we show that the ribonucleoside analog β-D-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC, EIDD-1931) has broad spectrum antiviral activity against SARS-CoV 2, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and related zoonotic group 2b or 2c Bat-CoVs, as well as increased potency against a coronavirus bearing resistance mutations to another nucleoside analog inhibitor. In mice infected with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, both prophylactic and therapeutic administration of EIDD-2801, an orally bioavailable NHC-prodrug (b-D-N4-hydroxycytidine-5’-isopropyl ester), improved pulmonary function, and reduced virus titer and body weight loss. Decreased MERS-CoV yields in vitro and in vivo were associated with increased transition mutation frequency in viral but not host cell RNA, supporting a mechanism of lethal mutagenesis. The potency of NHC/EIDD-2801 against multiple coronaviruses, its therapeutic efficacy, and oral bioavailability in vivo, all highlight its potential utility as an effective antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 and other future zoonotic coronaviruses.', '[TITLE]: An orally bioavailable broad-spectrum antiviral inhibits SARS-CoV-2 in human airway epithelial cell cultures and multiple coronaviruses in mice [AUTHORS]: Sheahan, Timothy P.; Sims, Amy C.; Zhou, Shuntai; Graham, Rachel L.; Pruijssers, Andrea J.; Agostini, Maria L.; Leist, Sarah R.; Schäfer, Alexandra; Dinnon, Kenneth H.; Stevens, Laura J.; Chappell, James D.; Lu, Xiaotao; Hughes, Tia M.; George, Amelia S.; Hill, Collin S.; Montgomery, Stephanie A.; Brown, Ariane J.; Bluemling, Gregory R.; Natchus, Michael G.; Saindane, Manohar; Kolykhalov, Alexander A.; Painter, George; Harcourt, Jennifer; Tamin, Azaibi; Thornburg, Natalie J.; Swanstrom, Ronald; Denison, Mark R.; Baric, Ralph S.

It was believed that 2019-nCoV was transmitted through respiratory tract and then induced pneumonia, thus molecular diagnosis based on oral swabs was used for confirmation of this disease. Likewise, patient will be released upon two times of negative detection from oral swabs. However, many coronaviruses can also be transmitted through oral–fecal route by infecting intestines. Whether 2019-nCoV infected patients also carry virus in other organs like intestine need to be tested. We conducted investigation on patients in a local hospital who were infected with this virus. We found the presence of 2019-nCoV in anal swabs and blood as well, and more anal swab positives than oral swab positives in a later stage of infection, suggesting shedding and thereby transmitted through oral–fecal route. We also showed serology test can improve detection positive rate thus should be used in future epidemiology. Our report provides a cautionary warning that 2019-nCoV may be shed through multiple routes.', '[TITLE]: Exploratory study reveals far reaching systemic and cellular effects of verapamil treatment in subjects with type 1 diabetes. [AUTHORS]: Xu, Guanlan; Grimes, Tiffany D; Grayson, Truman B; Chen, Junqin; Thielen, Lance A; Tse, Hubert M; Li, Peng; Kanke, Matt; Lin, Tai-Tu; Schepmoes, Athena A; Swensen, Adam C; Petyuk, Vladislav A; Ovalle, Fernando; Sethupathy, Praveen; Qian, Wei-Jun; Shalev, Anath [JOURNAL]: Nature communications [ABSTRACT]: Currently, no oral medications are available for type 1 diabetes (T1D). While our recent randomized placebo-controlled T1D trial revealed that oral verapamil had short-term beneficial effects, their duration and underlying mechanisms remained elusive. Now, our global T1D serum proteomics analysis identified chromogranin A (CHGA), a T1D-autoantigen, as the top protein altered by verapamil and as a potential therapeutic marker and revealed that verapamil normalizes serum CHGA levels and reverses T1D-induced elevations in circulating proinflammatory T-follicular-helper cell markers. RNA-sequencing further confirmed that verapamil regulates the thioredoxin system and promotes an anti-oxidative, anti-apoptotic and immunomodulatory gene expression profile in human islets. Moreover, continuous use of oral verapamil delayed T1D progression, promoted endogenous beta-cell function and lowered insulin requirements and serum CHGA levels for at least 2 years and these benefits were lost upon discontinuation. Thus, the current studies provide crucial mechanistic and clinical insight into the beneficial effects of verapamil in T1D.', \"[TITLE]: 28-day repeated dose toxicological evaluation of Coronil in Sprague Dawley rats: Behavioral, hematological, biochemical and histopathological assessments under GLP compliance [AUTHORS]: Balkrishna, A.; Sinha, S.; Varshney, A. [JOURNAL]: Drug & Chemical Toxicology [ABSTRACT]: Ayurvedic medicines are widely employed globally for prophylaxis and treatment of a variety of diseases. Coronil is a tri-herbal medicine, constituted with the traditional herbs, Tinospora cordifolia, Withania somnifera and Ocimum sanctum, with known immunomodulatory activities. Based on its proven in-vitro activity and in-vivo efficacy, Coronil has been approved as a 'Supporting Measure for COVID-19' by the Ministry of AYUSH, Government of India. The current study was aimed to assess the non-clinical safety of Coronil in a 28-day repeated dose toxicity study along with a 14-day recovery period in Sprague Dawley rats. This toxicity study was conducted in accordance with OECD test guideline 407, under GLP-compliance. Specific-Pathogen-Free animals of either sex, housed in Individually-Ventilated-Cages were particularly used in the study. The tested Coronil dose levels were 0, 100, 300 and 1000 mg/kg/day, orally administered to 5 males and 5 female rats per test group. In the current study, no mortality was observed in any group and in addition, Coronil did not elicit any finding of toxicological relevance with respect to clinical signs, ocular effects, hematology, urinalysis and clinical chemistry parameters, as well as macro- or microscopical changes in any organs, when compared to the control group. Accordingly, the No-Observed-Adverse-Effect-Level (NOAEL) of Coronil was ascertained to be 1000 mg/kg/day, subsequent to its 28-day oral administration to male and female rats. The acceptable safety profile of Coronil paves the way further toxicity assessments in rodents for a longer duration as well as in higher animals, and towards its clinical investigation.\", '[TITLE]: Use of N-Acetylcysteine at high doses as an oral treatment for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 [AUTHORS]: Izquierdo, José Luis; Soriano, Joan B; González, Yolanda; Lumbreras, Sara; Ancochea, Julio; Echeverry, Christian; Rodríguez, José Miguel [JOURNAL]: Sci Prog [ABSTRACT]: Infection by SARS-CoV-2 causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can be associated with serious and life-threatening conditions, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Severity and mortality have been related to a cytokine storm, an imbalance of oxidative stress, and a pro-thrombotic state. We conducted an observational retrospective cohort study from a community-based large population of hospitalized COVID-19 PCR + patients admitted from March 01, 2020, to January 24, 2021, with integrated primary to tertiary care information in Castilla la Mancha, Spain. We explored the potential benefits of the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic drug N-acetylcysteine (NAC) administered orally in high doses (600 mg every 8 h), added to standard of care in COVID-19 patients by using the free text information contained in their electronic health records (EHRs). Out of 19,208 patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 hospitalized, we studied 2071 (10.8%) users of oral NAC at high doses. COVID-19 patients treated with NAC were older, predominantly male, and with more comorbidities such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and COPD when compared with those not on NAC (all p < 0.05). Despite greater baseline risk, use of NAC in COVID-19 patients was associated with significantly lower mortality (OR 0.56; 95%CI 0.47–0.67), a finding that remained significant in a multivariate analysis adjusting by baseline characteristics and concomitant use of corticosteroids. There were no significant differences with the use of NAC on the mean duration of hospitalization, admission to the intensive care unit or use of invasive mechanical ventilation. The observed association signaling to better relevant outcomes in COVID-19 patients treated with NAC at high doses should be further explored in other settings and populations and in randomized controlled trials.', '[TITLE]: A predictive model for preterm babies born < 30 weeks gestational age who will not attain full oral feedings [AUTHORS]: Gehle, Daniel B.; Chapman, Alison; Gregoski, Mathew; Brunswick, Meghan; Anderson, Emily; Ramakrishnan, Viswanathan; Muhammad, Lutfiyya N.; Head, William; Lesher, Aaron P.; Ryan, Rita M. [JOURNAL]: J Perinatol [ABSTRACT]: OBJECTIVE: Develop a model to predict gastrostomy tube (GT) for feeding at discharge in infants born < 30 weeks’ (w) gestational age (GA). STUDY DESIGN: A single-center retrospective study at academic NICU. Total of 391 (78 GT, 313 non-GT) infants < 30 w GA admitted in 2015–2018 split into test (15–16) and validation (17–18) cohorts. Classification and regression tree analysis was used to identify predictive factors for GT. RESULTS: Several factors were associated with GT requirements. Four factors included in the model were postmenstrual age (PMA) at first oral feeding, birth GA, high-frequency ventilation exposure, necrotizing enterocolitis stage II/III. Area under the receiver operator characteristic curve was 0.944 in the test cohort, 0.815 in the validation cohort. Implementation plan based on the model was developed. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a predictive model to risk-stratify infants born < 30 w GA for failing full oral feeding. We hope implementation at 38 w PMA will result in earlier placement of needed GT and discharge.', '[TITLE]: Resolutive results with oral corticosteroids for patients with COVID-19 in pulmonary inflammatory phase.

[JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: In the face of new diseases, medicine needs to reinvent itself in order to contain and control epidemics, such as the one we have recently faced, COVID-19, a disease with a wide spectrum of clinical severity. A new moment has been established, since the application of well known, effective and safe medications for other diseases, has shown high success rates in the treatment of COVID-19. Thereunto, studies with early intervention are needed, which can change the unfavorable outcome of patients. In this article, we report the successful experience using an oral strategy during the collapse of Belem do Para Health System, Brazil. Two hundred and ten patients were diagnosed with respiratory failure due to COVID-19, with no option of hospital treatment due to lack of beds and resources. These patients were then started on therapeutic regimen consisting of prednisolone, enoxaparin and macrolides associated and followed in outpatient facilities. Two hundred and eight patients had excellent therapeutic response and there were only two fatalities. These results push research boundaries, valuing outpatient treatment with early use of prednisolone in the initial pulmonary phase, preventing severe COVID-19 pneumonitis. Adoption of the proposed treatment intends to reduce the need for hospitalization, as well as lethality, with social robust benefits and incalculable economic savings since involves the use of accessible, safe and not expensive medications.', '[TITLE]: Naltrexone treatment for prolonged grief disorder: study protocol for a randomized, triple-blinded, placebo-controlled trial [AUTHORS]: Gang, James; Kocsis, James; Avery, Jonathan; Maciejewski, Paul K.; Prigerson, Holly G. [JOURNAL]: Trials [ABSTRACT]: BACKGROUND: There is a lack of effective pharmacotherapy for prolonged grief disorder (PGD). Evidence suggests that the neurobiology of PGD involves the same circuitry as the reward pathway. Based upon this evidence, we hypothesize that PGD can be conceptualized as a disorder of addiction and therefore could benefit from being treated with medications that are currently used to treat such disorders. One such medication is naltrexone, which is currently used to treat alcohol and opioid dependence. Oral naltrexone was chosen for its mechanism of action, safety, and convenience. The primary aim of this study is to establish the efficacy of using oral naltrexone as a pharmacological treatment for PGD. Specifically, we hypothesize that participants receiving naltrexone will demonstrate reduced PGD symptoms when compared to placebo. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, triple-blinded (to healthcare professionals/study staff, participants, and data analysts) study in which we propose to enroll 48 participants who meet criteria for Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD). Participants will be randomly assigned to the naltrexone 50 mg oral arm or placebo arm; medications will be over-encapsulated to appear identical. Participants will take their assigned medication for 8 weeks, with clinic visits every 4 weeks to assess symptom severity, social closeness, and adverse reactions. Weekly surveys of Prolonged Grief-13-Revised (PG-13-R) will be used to relate naltrexone use to changes in PGD symptom severity. Follow-up 4 weeks after their last visit will assess the longevity of treatment, as well as any lingering adverse reactions. DISCUSSION: This study is the first to investigate the use of oral naltrexone as pharmacological treatment for PGD. The acute and debilitating nature of the disorder, in addition to the increased risk of comorbidities, highlights the need for pharmacological treatment like naltrexone that can act more rapidly, may help those for whom psychotherapy may not be effective, and/or may augment psychotherapy to promote PGD symptom grief resolution.

We hypothesized that fewer patients administered this combination would require oxygen therapy, intensive care support, or a combination of both than those who did not. METHODS: This was a cohort observational study of all consecutive hospitalized patients ≥50 y of age with COVID-19 in a tertiary academic hospital. Before April 6, 2020, no patients received the (DMB) combination. After this date, patients were administered 1000 IU/d oral vitamin D(3), 150 mg/d oral magnesium, and 500 mcg/d oral vitamin B(12) upon admission if they did not require oxygen therapy. Primary outcome was deterioration leading to any form of oxygen therapy, intensive care support, or both. RESULTS: Between January 15 and April 15, 2020, we identified 43 consecutive patients ≥50 y of age with COVID-19. Seventeen patients received DMB before onset of primary outcome and 26 patients did not. Baseline demographic characteristics between the two groups were significantly different by age. In univariate analysis, age and hypertension had a significant influence on outcome. After adjusting for age or hypertension separately in a multivariate analysis, the intervention group retained protective significance. Fewer treated patients than controls required initiation of oxygen therapy during hospitalization (17.6 vs 61.5%, P = 0.006). DMB exposure was associated with odds ratios of 0.13 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.03–0.59) and 0.20 (95% CI, 0.04–0.93) for oxygen therapy, intensive care support, or both on univariate and multivariate analyses, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A vitamin D / magnesium / vitamin B(12) combination in older COVID-19 patients was associated with a significant reduction in the proportion of patients with clinical deterioration requiring oxygen support, intensive care support, or both. This study supports further larger randomized controlled trials to ascertain the full benefit of this combination in ameliorating the severity of COVID-19.', '[TITLE]: Resolutive results with oral corticosteroids for patients with COVID-19 in pulmonary inflammatory phase. successful outpatient experience during the collapse of Belem do Para health system-Brazil [AUTHORS]: Zeballos, R.

David [JOURNAL]: Nutrients [ABSTRACT]: There are limited proven therapies for COVID-19. Vitamin C’s antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating effects make it a potential therapeutic candidate, both for the prevention and amelioration of COVID-19 infection, and as an adjunctive therapy in the critical care of COVID-19. This literature review focuses on vitamin C deficiency in respiratory infections, including COVID-19, and the mechanisms of action in infectious disease, including support of the stress response, its role in preventing and treating colds and pneumonia, and its role in treating sepsis and COVID-19. The evidence to date indicates that oral vitamin C (2–8 g/day) may reduce the incidence and duration of respiratory infections and intravenous vitamin C (6–24 g/day) has been shown to reduce mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stays, and time on mechanical ventilation for severe respiratory infections. Further trials are urgently warranted. Given the favourable safety profile and low cost of vitamin C, and the frequency of vitamin C deficiency in respiratory infections, it may be worthwhile testing patients’ vitamin C status and treating them accordingly with intravenous administration within ICUs and oral administration in hospitalised persons with COVID-19.', '[TITLE]: The oral protease inhibitor (PF-07321332) protects Syrian hamsters against infection with SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern [AUTHORS]: Abdelnabi, Rana; Foo, Caroline S.; Jochmans, Dirk; Vangeel, Laura; De Jonghe, Steven; Augustijns, Patrick; Mols, Raf; Weynand, Birgit; Wattanakul, Thanaporn; Hoglund, Richard M.; Tarning, Joel; Mowbray, Charles E.; Sjö, Peter; Escudié, Fanny; Scandale, Ivan; Chatelain, Eric; Neyts, Johan [JOURNAL]: Nat Commun [ABSTRACT]: There is an urgent need for potent and selective antivirals against SARS-CoV-2. Pfizer developed PF-07321332 (PF-332), a potent inhibitor of the viral main protease (Mpro, 3CLpro) that can be dosed orally and that is in clinical development. We here report that PF-332 exerts equipotent in vitro activity against the four SARS-CoV-2 variants of concerns (VoC) and that it can completely arrest replication of the alpha variant in primary human airway epithelial cells grown at the air-liquid interface. Treatment of Syrian Golden hamsters with PF-332 (250 mg/kg, twice daily) completely protected the animals against intranasal infection with the beta (B.1.351) and delta (B.1.617.2) SARS-CoV-2 variants. Moreover, treatment of SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.617.2) infected animals with PF-332 completely prevented transmission to untreated co-housed sentinels.', '[TITLE]: Factors associated with resolution of type-2 diabetes mellitus after sleeve gastrectomy in obese adults. [AUTHORS]: Salman, Ahmed Abdallah; Salman, Mohamed Abdalla; Marie, Mohamed A; Rabiee, Ahmed; Helmy, Mona Youssry; Tourky, Mohamed Sabry; Qassem, Mohamed Gamal; Shaaban, Hossam El-Din; Sarhan, Mohamed D [JOURNAL]: Scientific reports [ABSTRACT]: Many bariatric procedures are more effective for improving type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) than conventional pharmacotherapy. The current research evaluated factors linked to complete and partial remission or improvement of T2DM after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). The current prospective study included all diabetic patients who were submitted LSG between January 2015 and June 2018 and completed a 2-year follow-up period. Patients were assessed at baseline and 2 years after LSG. This work comprised of 226 diabetic cases. Two years after LSG, 86 patients (38.1%) achieved complete remission of DM, and 24 (10.6%) reached partial remission. Only 14 patients (6.2%) showed no change in their diabetic status. On univariate analysis, age ≤ 45 years, duration of diabetes ≤ 5 years, use of a single oral antidiabetic, HbA1c ≤ 6.5%, HOMA-IR ≤ 4.6, C-peptide > 2.72 ng/mL, and BMI ≤ 40 kg/m2 predicted complete remission. The independent predictors of complete remission were age ≤ 45 years, duration of diabetes ≤ 5 years, use of a single oral antidiabetic, HOMA-IR ≤ 4.6, and C-peptide > 2.72 ng/mL. A combined marker of young age, short duration of DM, and low HOMA-IR predicted complete remission with sensitivity 93% and specificity 82%. Independent predictors of complete remission of T2DM after LSG were younger age, shorter duration, single oral antidiabetic, lower HOMA-IR, and higher C-peptide.', '[TITLE]: Molnupiravir, an Oral Antiviral Treatment for COVID-19 [AUTHORS]: Fischer, W. A.; Eron, J. J.; Holman, W.; Cohen, M. S.; Fang, L.; Szewczyk, L. J.; Sheahan, T. P.; Baric, R. S.; Mollan, K. R.; Wolfe, C. R.; Duke, E. R.; Azizad, M. M.; BorrotoiEsoda, K.; Wohl, D. A.; Loftis, A. J.; Alabanza, P.; Lipansky, F.; Painter, W. P. [JOURNAL]: medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences [ABSTRACT]: Background: Easily distributed oral antivirals are urgently needed to treat coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), prevent progression to severe illness, and block transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We report the results of a Phase 2a trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, and antiviral efficacy of molnupiravir in the treatment of COVID-19 (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04405570). Methods: Eligible participants included outpatients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptom onset within 7 days. Participants were randomized 1:1 to 200 mg molnupiravir or placebo, or 3:1 to molnupiravir (400 or 800 mg) or placebo, twice daily for 5 days. Antiviral activity was assessed as time to undetectable levels of viral RNA by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and time to elimination of infectious virus isolation from nasopharyngeal swabs. Results: Among 202 treated participants, virus isolation was significantly lower in participants receiving 800 mg molnupiravir (1.9%) versus placebo (16.7%) at Day 3 (p = 0.02). At Day 5, virus was not isolated from any participants receiving 400 or 800 mg molnupiravir, versus 11.1% of those receiving placebo (p = 0.03). Time to viral RNA clearance was decreased and a greater proportion overall achieved clearance in participants administered 800 mg molnupiravir versus placebo (p = 0.01). Molnupiravir was generally well tolerated, with similar numbers of adverse events across all groups. Conclusions: Molnupiravir is the first oral, direct acting antiviral shown to be highly effective at reducing nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 infectious virus and viral RNA and has a favorable safety and tolerability profile.', \"[TITLE]: 4'-Fluorouridine is an oral antiviral that blocks respiratory syncytial virus and SARS-CoV-2 replication [AUTHORS]: Sourimant, J.; Lieber, C. M.; Aggarwal, M.; Cox, R. M.; Wolf, J. D.; Yoon, J. J.; Toots, M.; Ye, C.; Sticher, Z.; Kolykhalov, A. A.; Martinez-Sobrid, L.; Bluemling, G. R.; Natchus, M. G.; Painter, G. R.; Plemper, R. K. [JOURNAL]: Science [ABSTRACT]: The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the critical need for broad-spectrum therapeutics against respiratory viruses. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major threat to pediatric patients and older adults. We describe 4'-fluorouridine (4'-FlU, EIDD-2749), a ribonucleoside analog that inhibits RSV, related RNA viruses, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with high selectivity index in cells and human airway epithelia organoids. Polymerase inhibition within in vitro RNA-dependent RNA polymerase assays established for RSV and SARS-CoV-2 revealed transcriptional stalling after incorporation. Once-daily oral treatment was highly efficacious at 5 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) in RSV-infected mice or 20 mg/kg in ferrets infected with different SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, initiated 24 or 12 hours after infection, respectively. These properties define 4'-FlU as a broad-spectrum candidate for the treatment of RSV, SARS-CoV-2, and related RNA virus infections.\", '[TITLE]: Effect of Colchicine vs Usual Care Alone on Intubation and 28-Day Mortality in Patients Hospitalized With COVID-19: A Randomized Clinical Trial [AUTHORS]: Diaz, Rafael; Orlandini, Andrés; Castellana, Noelia; Caccavo, Alberto; Corral, Pablo; Corral, Gonzalo; Chacón, Carolina; Lamelas, Pablo; Botto, Fernando; Díaz, María Luz; Domínguez, Juan Manuel; Pascual, Andrea; Rovito, Carla; Galatte, Agustina; Scarafia, Franco; Sued, Omar; Gutierrez, Omar; Jolly, Sanjit S.; Miró, José M.; Eikelboom, John; Loeb, Mark; Maggioni, Aldo Pietro; Bhatt, Deepak L.; Yusuf, Salim [JOURNAL]: JAMA Netw Open [ABSTRACT]: IMPORTANCE: Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia have high rates of morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of colchicine in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Estudios Clínicos Latino América (ECLA) Population Health Research Institute (PHRI) COLCOVID trial was a multicenter, open-label, randomized clinical trial performed from April 17, 2020, to March 28, 2021, in adults with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection followed for up to 28 days. Participants received colchicine vs usual care if they were hospitalized with COVID-19 symptoms and had severe acute respiratory syndrome or oxygen desaturation. The main exclusion criteria were clear indications or contraindications for colchicine, chronic kidney disease, and negative results on a reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction test for SARS-CoV-2 before randomization. Data were analyzed from June 20 to July 25, 2021. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to usual care or usual care plus colchicine. Colchicine was administered orally in a loading dose of 1.5 mg immediately after randomization, followed by 0.5 mg orally within 2 hours of the initial dose and 0.5 mg orally twice a day for 14 days or discharge, whichever occurred first. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The first coprimary outcome was the composite of a new requirement for mechanical ventilation or death evaluated at 28 days. The second coprimary outcome was death at 28 days. RESULTS: A total of 1279 hospitalized patients (mean [SD] age, 61.8 [14.6] years; 449 [35.1%] women and 830 [64.9%] men) were randomized, including 639 patients in the usual care group and 640 patients in the colchicine group. Corticosteroids were used in 1171 patients (91.5%). The coprimary outcome of mechanical ventilation or 28-day death occurred in 160 patients (25.0%) in the colchicine group and 184 patients (28.8%) in the usual care group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.83; 95% CI, 0.67-1.02; P = .08). The second coprimary outcome, 28-day death, occurred in 131 patients (20.5%) in the colchicine group and 142 patients (22.2%) in the usual care group (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.70-1.12). Diarrhea was the most frequent adverse effect of colchicine, reported in 68 patients (11.3%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This randomized clinical trial found that compared with usual care, colchicine did not significantly reduce mechanical ventilation or 28-day mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia.

[JOURNAL]: Nutr Clin Pract [ABSTRACT]: Although Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is primarily a respiratory disease, growing evidence shows that it can affect the digestive system and present with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. Various nutrition societies have recently published their guidelines in context of the pandemic, and several points emphasize the impact of these GI manifestations on nutrition therapy. In patients with COVID‐19, the normal intestinal mucosa can be disrupted by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) virus, and this could result in GI symptoms and a compromise in nutrient absorption. Optimization of oral diet is still recommended. However, given the GI effects of COVID‐19, a fraction of infected patients have poor appetite and would not be able to meet their nutrition goals with oral diet alone. For this at‐risk group, which includes those who are critically ill, enteral nutrition is the preferred route to promote gut integrity and immune function. In carrying this out, nutrition support practices have been revised in such ways to mitigate viral transmission and adapt to the pandemic. All measures in the GI and nutrition care of patients are clustered to limit exposure of healthcare workers. Among patients admitted to intensive care units, a significant barrier is GI intolerance, and it appears to be exacerbated by significant GI involvement specific to the SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Nevertheless, several countermeasures can be used to ease side effects. At the end of the spectrum in which intolerance persists, the threshold for switching to parenteral nutrition may need to be lowered.', '[TITLE]: Famotidine use and quantitative symptom tracking for COVID-19 in non-hospitalised patients: a case series [AUTHORS]: Janowitz, Tobias; Gablenz, Eva; Pattinson, David; Wang, Timothy C; Conigliaro, Joseph; Tracey, Kevin; Tuveson, David [JOURNAL]: Gut [ABSTRACT]: OBJECTIVE: Treatment options for non-hospitalised patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to reduce morbidity, mortality and spread of the disease are an urgent global need. The over-the-counter histamine-2 receptor antagonist famotidine is a putative therapy for COVID-19. We quantitively assessed longitudinal changes in patient reported outcome measures in non-hospitalised patients with COVID-19 who self-administered high-dose famotidine orally. DESIGN: Patients were enrolled consecutively after signing written informed consent. Data on demographics, COVID-19 diagnosis, famotidine use, drug-related side effects, temperature measurements, oxygen saturations and symptom scores were obtained using questionnaires and telephone interviews. Based on a National Institute of Health (NIH)-endorsed Protocol to research Patient Experience of COVID-19, we collected longitudinal severity scores of five symptoms (cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, headaches and anosmia) and general unwellness on a four-point ordinal scale modelled on performance status scoring. All data are reported at the patient level. Longitudinal combined normalised symptom scores were statistically compared. RESULTS: Ten consecutive patients with COVID-19 who self-administered high-dose oral famotidine were identified. The most frequently used famotidine regimen was 80 mg three times daily (n=6) for a median of 11 days (range: 5–21 days). Famotidine was well tolerated. All patients reported marked improvements of disease related symptoms after starting famotidine. The combined symptom score improved significantly within 24 hours of starting famotidine and peripheral oxygen saturation (n=2) and device recorded activity (n=1) increased. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this case series suggest that high-dose oral famotidine is well tolerated and associated with improved patient-reported outcomes in non-hospitalised patients with COVID-19.', '[TITLE]: Possible Therapeutic Effects of Adjuvant Quercetin Supplementation Against Early-Stage COVID-19 Infection: A Prospective, Randomized, Controlled, and Open-Label Study [AUTHORS]: Di Pierro, Francesco; Derosa, Giuseppe; Maffioli, Pamela; Bertuccioli, Alexander; Togni, Stefano; Riva, Antonella; Allegrini, Pietro; Khan, Amjad; Khan, Saeed; Khan, Bilal Ahmad; Altaf, Naireen; Zahid, Maria; Ujjan, Ikram Din; Nigar, Roohi; Khushk, Mehwish Imam; Phulpoto, Maryam; Lail, Amanullah; Devrajani, Bikha Ram; Ahmed, Sagheer [JOURNAL]: Int J Gen Med [ABSTRACT]: BACKGROUND: Quercetin, a well-known naturally occurring polyphenol, has recently been shown by molecular docking, in vitro and in vivo studies to be a possible anti-COVID-19 candidate. Quercetin has strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antiviral properties, and it is characterized by a very high safety profile, exerted in animals and in humans. Like most other polyphenols, quercetin shows a very low rate of oral absorption and its clinical use is considered by most of modest utility. Quercetin in a delivery-food grade system with sunflower phospholipids (Quercetin Phytosome(®), QP) increases its oral absorption up to 20-fold. METHODS: In the present prospective, randomized, controlled, and open-label study, a daily dose of 1000 mg of QP was investigated for 30 days in 152 COVID-19 outpatients to disclose its adjuvant effect in treating the early symptoms and in preventing the severe outcomes of the disease. RESULTS: The results revealed a reduction in frequency and length of hospitalization, in need of non-invasive oxygen therapy, in progression to intensive care units and in number of deaths. The results also confirmed the very high safety profile of quercetin and suggested possible anti-fatigue and pro-appetite properties. CONCLUSION: QP is a safe agent and in combination with standard care, when used in early stage of viral infection, could aid in improving the early symptoms and help in preventing the severity of COVID-19 disease. It is suggested that a double-blind, placebo-controlled study should be urgently carried out to confirm the results of our study.', '[TITLE]: The angiotensin type 2 receptor agonist C21 restores respiratory function in COVID19 - a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial [AUTHORS]: Tornling, G.; Batta, R.; Porter, J.; Bengtsson, T.; Parmar, K.; Kashiva, R.; Cohrt, A. K.; Westergaard, K.; Hallberg, A.; Dalsgaard, C.-J.; Raud, J. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Background: Although several therapies have been evaluated for treatment of COVID-19, the morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 are still significant, and the need for safe and effective drugs remains high even after launch of vaccine programs. Methods: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with the novel oral angiotensin II type 2 receptor agonist C21 in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with C-reactive protein 50-150 mg/L but not needing mechanical ventilation. Patients were randomly assigned to oral C21 (100 mg twice daily) or placebo for 7 days in addition to standard of care, including glucocorticoids and remdesivir. Results: 106 patients underwent randomization (51 in the C21 group and 55 in the placebo group). At day 14 after start of treatment, the proportion of patients still requiring supplemental oxygen was significantly reduced by 90% in the C21 group compared to the placebo group (p=0.003). Moreover, fewer patients required mechanical ventilation (one C21 patient and four placebo patients), and C21 was associated with a numerical reduction in the mortality rate (one and three deaths in the C21 and placebo group, respectively). Treatment with C21 was safe and well tolerated. Conclusions: As studied in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, C21 on top of standard of care led to a clinically beneficial improvement in respiratory function compared to placebo, paving the way for a pivotal randomised controlled trial.', '[TITLE]: Changes in 25‐hydroxyvitamin D levels post‐vitamin D supplementation in people of Black and Asian ethnicities and its implications during COVID‐19 pandemic: A systematic review [AUTHORS]: Vaughan, Megan; Trott, Mike; Sapkota, Raju; Premi, Gurmel; Roberts, Justin; Ubhi, Jaspal; Smith, Lee; Pardhan, Shahina [JOURNAL]: J Hum Nutr Diet [ABSTRACT]: BACKGROUND: People of Black and Asian ethnicities have a higher infection rate and mortality as a result of COVID‐19. It has also been reported that vitamin D deficiency may play a role in this, possibly because of the multi‐gene regulatory function of the vitamin D receptor. As a result, increased dietary intake and/or supplementation to attain adequate 25‐hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels could benefit people in these ethnicities. The present study aimed to review the literature examining the changes in 25(OH)D in different types of vitamin D supplementation from randomised controlled trials in this population. METHODS: This systematic review was conducted using the PRISMA guidelines. Electronic databases were systematically searched using keywords related to vitamin D supplementation in Black and Asian ethnicities. RESULTS: Eight studies were included in the review. All the included studies found that supplementation of vitamin D (D(2) and D(3)), regardless of dosage, increased 25(OH)D levels compared to a placebo. All trials in which participants were vitamin D deficient at baseline showed increased 25(OH)D levels to a level considered adequate. Two studies that used food fortification yielded smaller 25(OH)D increases compared to similar studies that used oral supplementation (10.2 vs. 25.5 nmol L(−1), respectively). Furthermore, vitamin D(2) supplementation yielded significantly lower 25(OH)D increases than vitamin D(3) supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: Oral vitamin D supplementation may be more efficacious in increasing 25(OH)D levels than food fortification of Black and Asian ethnicities, with vitamin D(3) supplementation possibly being more efficacious than vitamin D(2). It is recommended that people with darker skin supplement their diet with vitamin D(3) through oral tablet modes where possible, with recent literature suggesting a daily intake of 7000–10,000 IU to be potentially protective from unfavourable COVID‐19 outcomes. As a result of the paucity of studies, these findings should be treated as exploratory.', '[TITLE]: A Randomized Phase 2/3 Study of Ensitrelvir, a Novel Oral SARS-CoV-2 3C-like Protease Inhibitor, in Japanese Patients With Mild-to-Moderate COVID-19 or Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Results of the Phase 2a Part [AUTHORS]: Mukae, H.; Yotsuyanagi, H.; Ohmagari, N.; Doi, Y.; Imamura, T.; Sonoyama, T.; Fukuhara, T.; Ichihashi, G.; Sanaki, T.; Baba, K.; Takeda, Y.; Tsuge, Y.; Uehara, T. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: For the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), antiviral agents that can achieve rapid severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reduction are warranted. This double-blind, phase 2a part of a phase 2/3 study assessed the efficacy and safety of ensitrelvir, a novel oral SARS-CoV-2 3C-like protease inhibitor, in Japanese patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Sixty-nine patients enrolled from 56 sites were randomized (1:1:1) to orally receive 5-day ensitrelvir fumaric acid (375 mg on day 1 followed by 125 mg daily or 750 mg on day 1 followed by 250 mg daily) or placebo and followed up until day 28. The primary outcome was change from baseline in SARS-CoV-2 viral titer. A total of 16, 14, and 17 patients in the ensitrelvir 125 mg, ensitrelvir 250 mg, and placebo groups, respectively, were included in the intention-to-treat population (mean age: 38.8, 40.4, and 38.0 years, respectively). On day 4, the change from baseline in SARS-CoV-2 viral titer (log10 50% tissue culture infectious dose/mL) in patients with positive viral titer and viral RNA at baseline was greater with ensitrelvir 125 mg (mean [standard deviation], -2.42 [1.42]; P = 0.0712) and 250 mg (-2.81 [1.21]; P = 0.0083) versus placebo (-1.54 [0.74]), and ensitrelvir treatment reduced SARS-CoV-2 RNA by -1.4 to -1.5 log10 copies/mL versus placebo. All adverse events were mild to moderate. Ensitrelvir treatment demonstrated rapid SARS-CoV-2 clearance and was well tolerated in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (Japan Registry of Clinical Trials identifier: jRCT2031210350).', '[TITLE]: Skeletal Muscle Wasting and Function Impairment in Intensive Care Patients With Severe COVID-19 [AUTHORS]: de Andrade-Junior, Mario Chueire; de Salles, Isabel Chateaubriand Diniz; de Brito, Christina May Moran; Pastore-Junior, Laerte; Righetti, Renato Fraga; Yamaguti, Wellington Pereira [JOURNAL]: Front Physiol [ABSTRACT]: Background: Intensive care patients commonly develop muscle wasting and functional impairment. However, the role of severe COVID-19 in the magnitude of muscle wasting and functionality in the acute critical disease is unknown. Objective: To perform a prospective characterization to evaluate the skeletal muscle mass and functional performance in intensive care patients with severe COVID-19. Methods: Thirty-two critically ill patients (93.8% male; age: 64.1 ± 12.6 years) with the diagnosis of the severe COVID-19 were prospectively recruited within 24 to 72 h following intensive care unit (ICU) admission, from April 2020 to October 2020, at Hospital Sírio-Libanês in Brazil. Patients were recruited if older than 18 years old, diagnosis of severe COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR, ICU stay and absence of limb amputation. Muscle wasting was determined through an ultrasound measurement of the rectus femoris cross-sectional area, the thickness of the anterior compartment of the quadriceps muscle (rectus femoris and vastus intermedius), and echogenicity. The peripheral muscle strength was assessed with a handgrip test. The functionality parameter was determined through the ICU mobility scale (IMS) and the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). All evaluations were performed on days 1 and 10. Results: There were significant reductions in the rectus femoris cross-section area (−30.1% [95% IC, −26.0% to −34.1%]; P < 0.05), thickness of the anterior compartment of the quadriceps muscle (−18.6% [95% IC, −14.6% to 22.5%]; P < 0.05) and handgrip strength (−22.3% [95% IC, 4.7% to 39.9%]; P < 0.05) from days 1 to 10. Patients showed increased mobility (0 [0–5] vs 4.5 [0–8]; P < 0.05), improvement in respiratory function (3 [3–3] vs 2 [1–3]; P < 0.05) and structure respiratory system (3 [3–3] vs 2 [1–3]; P < 0.05), but none of the patients returned to normal levels. Conclusion: In intensive care patients with severe COVID-19, muscle wasting and decreased muscle strength occurred early and rapidly during 10 days of ICU stay with improved mobility and respiratory functions, although they remained below normal levels. These findings may provide insights into skeletal muscle wasting and function in patients with severe COVID-19.', '[TITLE]: Virucidal activity of CPC-containing oral rinses against SARS-CoV-2 variants and are active in the presence of human saliva [AUTHORS]: Anderson, Enyia R; Patterson, Edward I; Richards, Siobhan; Green, Alison; Mukherjee, Sayandip; Hoptroff, Michael; Hughes, Grant L [JOURNAL]: bioRxiv [ABSTRACT]: The role of human saliva in aerosol-based transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has highlighted the need to understand the potential of oral hygiene products to inactivate the virus. Here we examined the efficacy of mouthwashes containing cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) or chlorhexidine (CHX) in inactivating SARS-CoV-2. After 30 seconds contact under standard aqueous conditions CPC mouthwashes achieved a ≥4.0log10 PFU/mL reduction in SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020) titres whereas comparable products containing CHX achieved <2.0log10 PFU/mL reduction. Further testing with CPC mouthwashes demonstrated efficacy against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants, with inactivation below the limit of detection observed against the Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351) and Gamma (P.1) variants. Virucidal efficacy of CPC mouthwash was also observed in the presence of human saliva with the product delivering ≥4.0log10 PFU/mL reduction in SARS-CoV-2 titres after 30 seconds providing additional evidence for the virucidal efficacy of CPC mouthwashes under simulated physiological conditions. Together these data suggest CPC-based mouthwashes are effective at inactivating SARS-CoV-2 and further supports the use of mouthwash to mitigate the risk of transmission during dentistry procedures.', '[TITLE]: Effects of adding L-arginine orally to standard therapy in patients with COVID-19: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial. Results of the first interim analysis [AUTHORS]: Fiorentino, Giuseppe; Coppola, Antonietta; Izzo, Raffaele; Annunziata, Anna; Bernardo, Mariano; Lombardi, Angela; Trimarco, Valentina; Santulli, Gaetano; Trimarco, Bruno [JOURNAL]: EClinicalMedicine [ABSTRACT]: BACKGROUND: We and others have previously demonstrated that the endothelium is a primary target of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and L-arginine has been shown to improve endothelial dysfunction. However, the effects of L-arginine have never been evaluated in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: This is a parallel-group, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted on patients hospitalized for severe COVID-19. Patients received 1.66 g L-arginine twice a day or placebo, administered orally. The primary efficacy endpoint was a reduction in respiratory support assessed 10 and 20 days after randomization. Secondary outcomes were the length of in-hospital stay, the time to normalization of lymphocyte number, and the time to obtain a negative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 on nasopharyngeal swab. This clinical trial had been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT04637906. FINDINGS: We present here the results of the initial interim analysis on the first 101 patients. No treatment-emergent serious adverse events were attributable to L-arginine. At 10-day evaluation, 71.1% of patients in the L-arginine arm and 44.4% in the placebo arm (p < 0.01) had the respiratory support reduced; however, a significant difference was not detected 20 days after randomization. Strikingly, patients treated with L-arginine exhibited a significantly reduced in-hospital stay vs placebo, with a median (interquartile range 25(th),75(th) percentile) of 46 days (45,46) in the placebo group vs 25 days (21,26) in the L-arginine group (p < 0.0001); these findings were also confirmed after adjusting for potential confounders including age, duration of symptoms, comorbidities, D-dimer, as well as antiviral and anticoagulant treatments. The other secondary outcomes were not significantly different between groups. INTERPRETATION: In this interim analysis, adding oral L-arginine to standard therapy in patients with severe COVID-19 significantly decreases the length of hospitalization and reduces the respiratory support at 10 but not at 20 days after starting the treatment.', '[TITLE]: Construction of the Enterococcal Strain Expressing Immunogenic Fragment of SARS-Cov-2 Virus [AUTHORS]: Suvorov, Alexander; Gupalova, Tatiana; Desheva, Yulia; Kramskaya, Tatiana; Bormotova, Elena; Koroleva, Irina; Kopteva, Olga; Leontieva, Galina [JOURNAL]: Front Pharmacol [ABSTRACT]: Contemporary SARS-Cov-2 pandemic, besides its dramatic global influence on the human race including health care systems, economies, and political decisions, opened a window for the global experiment with human vaccination employing novel injectable vaccines providing predominantly specific IgG response with little knowledge of their impact on the mucosal immunity. However, it is widely accepted that protection against the pathogens at the gates of the infection - on mucosal surfaces—predominantly rely on an IgA response. Some genetically modified bacteria, including probiotics, represent attractive vehicles for oral or nasal mucosal delivery of therapeutic molecules. Probiotic-based vaccines for mucous membranes are easy to produce in large quantities; they have low cost, provide quite a long T-cell memory, and gut IgA response to oral vaccines is highly synchronized and strongly oligoclonal. Here we present a study demonstrating construction of the novel SARS-Cov-2 vaccine candidate employing the gene fragment of S1 SARS-Cov-2 gene. This DNA fragment was inserted in frame into major pili protein gene with d2 domain of enterococcal operon encoding for pili. The DNA sequencing proved the presence of the insert in enterococcal genome. RNA transcription, immunoprecipitation, and immune electron microscopy with human sera obtained from the SARS-Cov-2 patients demonstrated expression of SARS-Cov-2 antigens in bacteria. Taken together the data obtained allowed considering this genetically modified probiotic strain as an interesting candidate for vaccine against SARS-Cov-2.', \"[TITLE]: Risk of COVID-19 hospital admission among children aged 5–17 years with asthma in Scotland: a national incident cohort study [AUTHORS]: Shi, Ting; Pan, Jiafeng; Katikireddi, Srinivasa Vittal; McCowan, Colin; Kerr, Steven; Agrawal, Utkarsh; Shah, Syed Ahmar; Simpson, Colin R; Ritchie, Lewis Duthie; Robertson, Chris; Sheikh, Aziz [JOURNAL]: Lancet Respir Med [ABSTRACT]: BACKGROUND: There is an urgent need to inform policy deliberations about whether children with asthma should be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 and, if so, which subset of children with asthma should be prioritised. We were asked by the UK's Joint Commission on Vaccination and Immunisation to undertake an urgent analysis to identify which children with asthma were at increased risk of serious COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS: This national incident cohort study was done in all children in Scotland aged 5–17 years who were included in the linked dataset of Early Pandemic Evaluation and Enhanced Surveillance of COVID-19 (EAVE II). We used data from EAVE II to investigate the risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation among children with markers of uncontrolled asthma defined by either previous asthma hospital admission or oral corticosteroid prescription in the previous 2 years. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to derive hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for the association between asthma and COVID-19 hospital admission, stratified by markers of asthma control (previous asthma hospital admission and number of previous prescriptions for oral corticosteroids within 2 years of the study start date). Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic status, comorbidity, and previous hospital admission. FINDINGS: Between March 1, 2020, and July 27, 2021, 752 867 children were included in the EAVE II dataset, 63 463 (8·4%) of whom had clinician-diagnosed-and-recorded asthma. Of these, 4339 (6·8%) had RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. In those with confirmed infection, 67 (1·5%) were admitted to hospital with COVID-19. Among the 689 404 children without asthma, 40 231 (5·8%) had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, of whom 382 (0·9%) were admitted to hospital with COVID-19. The rate of COVID-19 hospital admission was higher in children with poorly controlled asthma than in those with well controlled asthma or without asthma. When using previous hospital admission for asthma as the marker of uncontrolled asthma, the adjusted HR was 6·40 (95% CI 3·27–12·53) for those with poorly controlled asthma and 1·36 (1·02–1·80) for those with well controlled asthma, compared with those with no asthma. When using oral corticosteroid prescriptions as the marker of uncontrolled asthma, the adjusted HR was 3·38 (1·84–6·21) for those with three or more prescribed courses of corticosteroids, 3·53 (1·87–6·67) for those with two prescribed courses of corticosteroids, 1·52 (0·90–2·57) for those with one prescribed course of corticosteroids, and 1·34 (0·98–1·82) for those with no prescribed course, compared with those with no asthma. INTERPRETATION: School-aged children with asthma with previous recent hospital admission or two or more courses of oral corticosteroids are at markedly increased risk of COVID-19 hospital admission and should be considered a priority for vaccinations. This would translate into 9124 children across Scotland and an estimated 109 448 children across the UK.

An appraisal with a systematic review [AUTHORS]: Gandhi, Gargi; Thimmappa, Latha; Upadhya, Nagaraja; Carnelio, Sunitha [JOURNAL]: Int J Dent Hyg [ABSTRACT]: OBJECTIVE: A wide variety of mouth rinses are available to combat micro‐organisms in the oral cavity. At the present global pandemic, the need of the hour is to control the viral infection due to the novel corona virus SARS‐COV‐2, as its port of entry is through the receptors located in the oral and pharyngeal mucosa. This systematic literature review focuses on the in vivo studies [randomized control trials (RCTs)] done on the efficacy of existing mouth rinses which have been used in reducing the viral loads. METHODS: The electronic database which includes PubMed‐MEDLINE, Google scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, ProQuest and CINAHL was searched from December 2019 to June 2021 with appropriate Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and Boolean operators. Two reviewers independently reviewed the abstracts. RESULTS: Of the 2438 retrieved titles, 905 remained after removing duplicates. Twelve articles were eligible to be included in this review of which seven were randomized with adequate sample size. CONCLUSIONS: Mouth washes containing povidone iodine and chlorhexidine decrease the viral load transiently. Large amount of in vivo studies are of paramount importance, especially RCTs, to prove the efficacy of these mouth rinses.', '[TITLE]: Fears and Perception of the Impact of COVID-19 on Patients With Lung Cancer: A Mono-Institutional Survey [AUTHORS]: Catania, Chiara; Spitaleri, Gianluca; Del Signore, Ester; Attili, Ilaria; Radice, Davide; Stati, Valeria; Gianoncelli, Letizia; Morganti, Stefania; de Marinis, Filippo [JOURNAL]: Front Oncol [ABSTRACT]: In February 2020, Italy became one of the first countries to be plagued by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, COVID-19. In March 2020, the Italian government decreed a lockdown for the whole country, which overturned communication systems, hospital organization, and access to patients and their relatives and carers. This issue had a particular regard for cancer patients. Our Thoracic Oncology Division therefore reorganized patient access in order to reduce the risk of contagion and, at the same time, encourage the continuation of treatment. Our staff contacted all patients to inform them of any changes in treatment planning, check that they were taking safety measures, and ascertain their feelings and whether they had any COVID-19 symptoms. To better understand patients’ fears and expectations of during the pandemic period, we created a nine-question interview, administered from April to May 2020 to 156 patients with lung cancer. Patients were classified by age, sex, comorbidity, disease stage, prior treatment, and treatment type. The survey showed that during the pandemic period some patients experienced fear of COVID-19, in particular: women (55% vs. 33%), patients with comorbidities (24% vs. 9%), and patients who had already received prior insult (radiotherapy or surgery) on the lung (30% vs. 11%). In addition, the patients who received oral treatment at home or for whom intravenous treatment was delayed, experienced a sense of relief (90% and 72% respectively). However, only 21% of the patients were more afraid of COVID-19 than of their cancer, in particular patients with long-term (> 12 months) vs. short-term cancer diagnosis (28% vs. 12.5%, respectively). Furthermore, the quarantine period or even just the lockdown period alone, worsened the quality of life of some patients (40%), especially those in oral treatment (47%). Our data demonstrate how lung cancer patients are more afraid of their disease than of a world pandemic. Also this interview indirectly highlights the clinician’s major guiding principle in correctly and appropriately managing not just the patient’s expectations of their illness and its treatment, but also and especially of the patient’s fears.', '[TITLE]: Antibiotic prescribing for respiratory tract infection in patients with suspected and proven COVID-19: results from an antibiotic point prevalence survey in Scottish hospitals [AUTHORS]: Seaton, R Andrew; Cooper, Lesley; Gibbons, Cheryl L; Malcolm, William; Choo-Kang, Brian; Griffith, David; Dundas, Stephanie; Brittain, Suzanne; Hamilton, Kayleigh; Jeffreys, Danielle; McKinney, Rachel; Guthrie, Debbie; Sneddon, Jacqueline [JOURNAL]: JAC Antimicrob Resist [ABSTRACT]: BACKGROUND: Bacterial co-infection is infrequently observed with SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 infection outside of critical care, however, antibiotics are commonly prescribed. OBJECTIVES: To examine factors associated with antibiotic prescribing for suspected respiratory tract infection (RTI) and evaluate the nature and dynamics of prescribing in hospitalized patients with suspected and proven COVID-19 infection. METHODS: An antibiotic point prevalence survey in hospitalized adult patients was conducted in designated COVID-19 clinical areas (including critical care) in 15 Scottish hospitals. Antibiotics prescribed for RTI and factors associated with prescribing were investigated. RESULTS: Of 820 surveyed patients, 272 (prevalence 33.3%) received antibiotics for suspected RTI on the survey day and 58.8% were SARS-CoV-2 positive. Antibiotics were empirical in 91.9% and amoxicillin (24.6%), doxycycline (20.5%) and co-amoxiclav (15%) were most frequently prescribed. Oral antibiotics were prescribed in 54.5% and duration was recorded in 76.7% on wards for a median of 5 days. IV to oral switch occurred after a median of 2 days. Prescribing for RTI was independently and positively associated with COPD/chronic lung disease, purulent/bloody sputum, abnormal chest X-ray, and CRP ≥ 100 mg/L. Probable and definite hospital-acquired COVID-19 and diabetes were associated with a lower odds of receiving an antibiotic for RTI. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic prescribing for suspected RTI was commonly observed and predominantly empirical in suspected or proven COVID-19. Initiatives to reinforce stewardship principles including clinical review, effective use of microbiological diagnostics and better understanding of the role of biomarkers are central to further limit unnecessary antibiotic therapy in COVID-19.', '[TITLE]: Therapeutic review of cabotegravir/rilpivirine long-acting antiretroviral injectable and implementation considerations at an HIV specialty clinic. [AUTHORS]: Howe, Zach W; Norman, Sarah; Lueken, Abbie F; Huesgen, Emily; Farmer, Eric K; Jarrell, Kaitlyn; Mathis, Joscelyn E; Bonham, Kyle W; Hahn, Julie [JOURNAL]: Pharmacotherapy [ABSTRACT]: Cabotegravir/rilpivirine (CAB/RPV) was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as the first complete parenteral antiretroviral (ART) regimen for treatment of people living with HIV (PLWH). As a monthly intramuscular (IM) injection, this therapy constitutes a major departure from the traditional paradigm of oral therapy requiring (at least) daily administration that has defined HIV treatment for decades. Composed of a second-generation integrase inhibitor (INSTI) and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), CAB/RPV has achieved high rates of sustained virologic suppression with a favorable safety profile for treatment-experienced PLWH following oral lead-in (OLI) during several clinical trials. In addition to the clinical benefits of this agent, patient-reported outcomes associated with convenience, confidentiality, and the tolerability of the injections have consistently reflected positive perceptions of CAB/RPV. The novel nature of this therapy in the field of HIV presents logistical challenges. Clinics will need to address barriers related to management of clinic workflow, procurement, reimbursement, and nonadherence. The aim of this review is to summarize the available safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) data of this long-acting (LA) injectable regimen as well as discuss some potential considerations for prescribing and operationalization.', '[TITLE]: Venomous Snakes Reveal Ecological and Phylogenetic Factors Influencing Variation in Gut and Oral Microbiomes [AUTHORS]: Smith, Sierra N.; Colston, Timothy J.; Siler, Cameron D. [JOURNAL]: Front Microbiol [ABSTRACT]: The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of vertebrates contains a series of organs beginning with the mouth and ending with the anus or cloacal opening. Each organ represents a unique environment for resident microorganisms. Due to their simple digestive anatomy, snakes are good models for studying microbiome variation along the GIT. Cloacal sampling captures the majority of the microbial diversity found in the GIT of snakes—yet little is known about the oral microbiota of snakes. Most research on the snake mouth and gut microbiota are limited to studies of a single species or captive-bred individuals. It therefore remains unclear how a host’s life history, diet, or evolutionary history correlate with differences in the microbial composition within the mouths and guts of wild snakes. We sampled the mouth and gut microbial communities from three species of Asian venomous snakes and utilized 16S rRNA microbial inventories to test if host phylogenetic and ecological differences correlate with distinct microbial compositions within the two body sites. These species occupy three disparate habitat types: marine, semi-arboreal, and arboreal, our results suggest that the diversity of snake mouth and gut microbial communities correlate with differences in both host ecology and phylogeny.', '[TITLE]: Can povidone Iodine gargle/mouthrinse inactivate SARS-CoV-2 and decrease the risk of nosocomial and community transmission during the COVID-19 pandemic? An evidence-based update [AUTHORS]: Chopra, diti; Sivaraman, Karthik; Radhakrishnan, Raghu; Balakrishnan, Dhanasekar; Narayana, Aparna [JOURNAL]: Jpn Dent Sci Rev [ABSTRACT]: The Coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19), also referred to as the novel ‘CoV19 (nCov19)’ is caused by a new coronavirus strain similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 spreads via respiratory droplets, saliva, or direct contact. Therefore it is important to control the viral load in the saliva and respiratory secretions. One of the most simple and cost-effective measures that can be adopted by the public and healthcare professionals to prevent cross-contamination and community transmission, is the implementation of effective oral and throat hygiene. Recent evidence has confirmed 0.5% PVP-I mouthrinse/gargle for 30 seconds can reduce SARS-CoV-2 virus infectivity to below detectable levels. PVP-I can even interrupt SARS-CoV-2 attachment to oral and nasopharyngeal tissues and lower the viral particles in the saliva and respiratory droplets. Thus the use of PVP-I mouthrinse as prophylactic measures has been advocated across the globe to reduce disease transmission. Although the efficacy of PVP-I against SARS-CoV-2 is proven, no review articles have yet discussed the evidence and mechanisms of PVP-I against the SARS-CoV-2. Thus, this paper highlights the rationale, safety, recommendations, and dosage of PVP-I gargle/mouthrinse as an effective method to decrease the viral loads during the pressing times of COVID-19.', '[TITLE]: The effect of mouthwashes on SARS-CoV-2 viral load: a systematic review [AUTHORS]: Silva, António; Azevedo, Maria; Sampaio-Maia, Benedita; Sousa-Pinto, Bernardo [JOURNAL]: J Am Dent Assoc [ABSTRACT]: Background Considering the oral cavity a major entryway and reservoir for SARS-CoV-2, the aim of this study was to perform a systematic review of in vivo and in vitro studies to assess the effectiveness of mouthwashes on SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Types of study We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, MedRxiv, and bioRxiv databases, including in vitro and in vivo studies assessing the virucidal effect of mouthwashes on SARS-CoV-2 or surrogates. From a total of 1622 articles retrieved, 39 were included in this systematic review. Results Povidone-iodine (PVP-I) was the most studied mouthwash (14 in vitro and 9 in vivo studies), frequently showing significant reductions in viral load in vitro assays. Similarly, cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) also showed good results, although evaluated in fewer studies. Chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) showed conflicting results on SARS-CoV-2 load reduction in both in vitro and in vivo studies. Practical implications PVP-I-based mouthwashes appear to be the best option as an oral pre-rinse in dental context for SARS-CoV-2 viral load reduction. Although the results of primary studies are relevant, there is a need for more in vivo studies on mouthwashes, in particular randomized controlled clinical trials, to better understand their effect on SARS-CoV-2 viral load and infection prevention.', '[TITLE]: \"Effect of Calcifediol Treatment and best Available Therapy versus best Available Therapy on Intensive Care Unit Admission and Mortality Among Patients Hospitalized for COVID-19: A Pilot Randomized Clinical study\" [AUTHORS]: Castillo, Marta Entrenas; Entrenas Costa, Luis Manuel; Vaquero Barrios, José Manuel; Alcalá Díaz, Juan Francisco; Miranda, José López; Bouillon, Roger; Quesada Gomez, José Manuel [JOURNAL]: J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol [ABSTRACT]: OBJECTIVE: The vitamin D endocrine system may have a variety of actions on cells and tissues involved in COVID-19 progression especially by decreasing the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. Calcifediol can rapidly increase serum 25OHD concentration. We therefore evaluated the effect of calcifediol treatment, on Intensive Care Unit Admission and Mortality rate among Spanish patients hospitalized for COVID-19. DESIGN: parallel pilot randomized open label, double-masked clinical trial. SETTING: university hospital setting (Reina Sofia University Hospital, Córdoba Spain.) PARTICIPANTS: 76 consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection, clinical picture of acute respiratory infection, confirmed by a radiographic pattern of viral pneumonia and by a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR with CURB65 severity scale (recommending hospital admission in case of total score > 1). PROCEDURES: All hospitalized patients received as best available therapy the same standard care, (per hospital protocol), of a combination of hydroxychloroquine (400 mg every 12 hours on the first day, and 200 mg every 12 hours for the following 5 days), azithromycin (500 mg orally for 5 days. Eligible patients were allocated at a 2 calcifediol:1 no calcifediol ratio through electronic randomization on the day of admission to take oral calcifediol (0.532 mg), or not. Patients in the calcifediol treatment group continued with oral calcifediol (0.266 mg) on day 3 and 7, and then weekly until discharge or ICU admission. Outcomes of effectiveness included rate of ICU admission and deaths. RESULTS: Of 50 patients treated with calcifediol, one required admission to the ICU (2%), while of 26 untreated patients, 13 required admission (50%) p value X(2) Fischer test p < 0.001. Univariate Risk Estimate Odds Ratio for ICU in patients with Calcifediol treatment versus without Calcifediol treatment: 0.02 (95%CI 0.002-0.17). Multivariate Risk Estimate Odds Ratio for ICU in patients with Calcifediol treatment vs Without Calcifediol treatment ICU (adjusting by Hypertension and T2DM): 0.03 (95%CI: 0.003-0.25). Of the patients treated with calcifediol, none died, and all were discharged, without complications. The 13 patients not treated with calcifediol, who were not admitted to the ICU, were discharged. Of the 13 patients admitted to the ICU, two died and the remaining 11 were discharged. CONCLUSION: Our pilot study demonstrated that administration of a high dose of Calcifediol or 25-hydroxyvitamin D, a main metabolite of vitamin D endocrine system, significantly reduced the need for ICU treatment of patients requiring hospitalization due to proven COVID-19. Calcifediol seems to be able to reduce severity of the disease, but larger trials with groups properly matched will be required to show a definitive answer.', '[TITLE]: Early estimates of the indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal and child mortality in low-income and middle-income countries: a modelling study [AUTHORS]: Roberton, Timothy; Carter, Emily D; Chou, Victoria B; Stegmuller, Angela R; Jackson, Bianca D; Tam, Yvonne; Sawadogo-Lewis, Talata; Walker, Neff [JOURNAL]: Lancet Glob Health [ABSTRACT]: BACKGROUND: While the COVID-19 pandemic will increase mortality due to the virus, it is also likely to increase mortality indirectly. In this study, we estimate the additional maternal and under-5 child deaths resulting from the potential disruption of health systems and decreased access to food. METHODS: We modelled three scenarios in which the coverage of essential maternal and child health interventions is reduced by 9·8–51·9% and the prevalence of wasting is increased by 10–50%. Although our scenarios are hypothetical, we sought to reflect real-world possibilities, given emerging reports of the supply-side and demand-side effects of the pandemic. We used the Lives Saved Tool to estimate the additional maternal and under-5 child deaths under each scenario, in 118 low-income and middle-income countries. We estimated additional deaths for a single month and extrapolated for 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. FINDINGS: Our least severe scenario (coverage reductions of 9·8–18·5% and wasting increase of 10%) over 6 months would result in 253 500 additional child deaths and 12 200 additional maternal deaths. Our most severe scenario (coverage reductions of 39·3–51·9% and wasting increase of 50%) over 6 months would result in 1 157 000 additional child deaths and 56 700 additional maternal deaths. These additional deaths would represent an increase of 9·8–44·7% in under-5 child deaths per month, and an 8·3–38·6% increase in maternal deaths per month, across the 118 countries. Across our three scenarios, the reduced coverage of four childbirth interventions (parenteral administration of uterotonics, antibiotics, and anticonvulsants, and clean birth environments) would account for approximately 60% of additional maternal deaths. The increase in wasting prevalence would account for 18–23% of additional child deaths and reduced coverage of antibiotics for pneumonia and neonatal sepsis and of oral rehydration solution for diarrhoea would together account for around 41% of additional child deaths. INTERPRETATION: Our estimates are based on tentative assumptions and represent a wide range of outcomes. Nonetheless, they show that, if routine health care is disrupted and access to food is decreased (as a result of unavoidable shocks, health system collapse, or intentional choices made in responding to the pandemic), the increase in child and maternal deaths will be devastating. We hope these numbers add context as policy makers establish guidelines and allocate resources in the days and months to come.

We aimed to compare direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) to warfarin in a real-world CVT cohort. METHODS This multicenter international retrospective study (United States, Europe, New Zealand) included consecutive patients with CVT treated with oral anticoagulation from January 2015 to December 2020. We abstracted demographics and CVT risk factors, hypercoagulable labs, baseline imaging data, and clinical and radiological outcomes from medical records. We used adjusted inverse probability of treatment weighted Cox-regression models to compare recurrent cerebral or systemic venous thrombosis, death, and major hemorrhage in patients treated with warfarin versus DOACs. We performed adjusted inverse probability of treatment weighted logistic regression to compare recanalization rates on follow-up imaging across the 2 treatments groups. RESULTS Among 1025 CVT patients across 27 centers, 845 patients met our inclusion criteria. Mean age was 44.8 years, 64.7% were women; 33.0% received DOAC only, 51.8% received warfarin only, and 15.1% received both treatments at different times. During a median follow-up of 345 (interquartile range, 140-720) days, there were 5.68 recurrent venous thrombosis, 3.77 major hemorrhages, and 1.84 deaths per 100 patient-years. Among 525 patients who met recanalization analysis inclusion criteria, 36.6% had complete, 48.2% had partial, and 15.2% had no recanalization. When compared with warfarin, DOAC treatment was associated with similar risk of recurrent venous thrombosis (aHR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.51-1.73]; P=0.84), death (aHR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.22-2.76]; P=0.70), and rate of partial/complete recanalization (aOR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.48-1.73]; P=0.79), but a lower risk of major hemorrhage (aHR, 0.35 [95% CI, 0.15-0.82]; P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS In patients with CVT, treatment with DOACs was associated with similar clinical and radiographic outcomes and favorable safety profile when compared with warfarin treatment. Our findings need confirmation by large prospective or randomized studies.', '[TITLE]: Effect of Oral Azithromycin vs Placebo on COVID-19 Symptoms in Outpatients With SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Randomized Clinical Trial. [AUTHORS]: Oldenburg, Catherine E; Pinsky, Benjamin A; Brogdon, Jessica; Chen, Cindi; Ruder, Kevin; Zhong, Lina; Nyatigo, Fanice; Cook, Catherine A; Hinterwirth, Armin; Lebas, Elodie; Redd, Travis; Porco, Travis C; Lietman, Thomas M; Arnold, Benjamin F; Doan, Thuy [JOURNAL]: JAMA [ABSTRACT]: Importance Azithromycin has been hypothesized to have activity against SARS-CoV-2. Objective To determine whether oral azithromycin in outpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to absence of self-reported COVID-19 symptoms at day 14. Design, Setting, and Participants Randomized clinical trial of azithromycin vs matching placebo conducted from May 2020 through March 2021. Outpatients from the US were enrolled remotely via internet-based surveys and followed up for 21 days. Eligible participants had a positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test result (nucleic acid amplification or antigen) within 7 days prior to enrollment, were aged 18 years or older, and were not hospitalized at the time of enrollment. Among 604 individuals screened, 297 were ineligible, 44 refused participation, and 263 were enrolled. Participants, investigators, and study staff were masked to treatment randomization. Interventions Participants were randomized in a 2:1 fashion to a single oral 1.2-g dose of azithromycin (n = 171) or matching placebo (n = 92). Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was absence of self-reported COVID-19 symptoms at day 14. There were 23 secondary clinical end points, including all-cause hospitalization at day 21. Results Among 263 participants who were randomized (median age, 43 years; 174 [66%] women; 57% non-Hispanic White and 29% Latinx/Hispanic), 76% completed the trial. The trial was terminated by the data and safety monitoring committee for futility after the interim analysis. At day 14, there was no significant difference in proportion of participants who were symptom free (azithromycin: 50%; placebo: 50%; prevalence difference, 0%; 95% CI, -14% to 15%; P > .99). Of 23 prespecified secondary clinical end points, 18 showed no significant difference. By day 21, 5 participants in the azithromycin group had been hospitalized compared with 0 in the placebo group (prevalence difference, 4%; 95% CI, -1% to 9%; P = .16). Conclusions and Relevance Among outpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, treatment with a single dose of azithromycin compared with placebo did not result in greater likelihood of being symptom free at day 14. These findings do not support the routine use of azithromycin for outpatient SARS-CoV-2 infection. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04332107.', '[TITLE]: Efficacy of glutathione therapy in relieving dyspnea associated with COVID-19 pneumonia: A report of 2 cases [AUTHORS]: Horowitz, Richard I.; Freeman, Phyllis R.; Bruzzese, James [JOURNAL]: Respir Med Case Rep [ABSTRACT]: PURPOSE: Infection with COVID-19 potentially can result in severe outcomes and death from “cytokine storm syndrome”, resulting in novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) with severe dyspnea, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), fulminant myocarditis and multiorgan dysfunction with or without disseminated intravascular coagulation. No published treatment to date has been shown to adequately control the inflammation and respiratory symptoms associated with COVID-19, apart from oxygen therapy and assisted ventilation. We evaluated the effects of using high dose oral and/or IV glutathione in the treatment of 2 patients with dyspnea secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: Two patients living in New York City (NYC) with a history of Lyme and tick-borne co-infections experienced a cough and dyspnea and demonstrated radiological findings consistent with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). A trial of 2 g of PO or IV glutathione was used in both patients and improved their dyspnea within 1 h of use. Repeated use of both 2000 mg of PO and IV glutathione was effective in further relieving respiratory symptoms. CONCLUSION: Oral and IV glutathione, glutathione precursors (N-acetyl-cysteine) and alpha lipoic acid may represent a novel treatment approach for blocking NF-κB and addressing “cytokine storm syndrome” and respiratory distress in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.', '[TITLE]: A Phase 2 Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-controlled Trial of Oral Camostat Mesylate for Early Treatment of COVID-19 Outpatients Showed Shorter Illness Course and Attenuation of Loss of Smell and Taste [AUTHORS]: Chupp, Geoffrey; Spichler-Moffarah, Anne; Søgaard, Ole S.; Esserman, Denise; Dziura, James; Danzig, Lisa; Chaurasia, Reetika; Patra, Kailash P.; Salovey, Aryeh; Nunez, Angela; May, Jeanine; Astorino, Lauren; Patel, Amisha; Halene, Stephanie; Wang, Jianhui; Hui, Pei; Patel, Prashant; Lu, Jing; Li, Fangyong; Gan, Geliang; Parziale, Stephen; Katsovich, Lily; Desir, Gary V.; Vinetz, Joseph M. [JOURNAL]: medRxiv [ABSTRACT]: IMPORTANCE: Early treatment of mild SARS-CoV-2 infection might lower the risk of clinical deterioration in COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether oral camostat mesylate would reduce upper respiratory SARS-CoV-2 viral load in newly diagnosed outpatients with mild COVID-19, and would lead to improvement in COVID-19 symptoms. DESIGN: From June, 2020 to April, 2021, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial. SETTING: Single site, academic medical center, outpatient setting in Connecticut, USA. PARTICIPANTS: Of 568 COVID-19 positive potential adult participants diagnosed within 3 days of study entry and assessed for eligibility, 70 were randomized and 498 were excluded (198 did not meet eligibility criteria, 37 were not interested, 265 were excluded for unknown or other reasons). The primary inclusion criteria were a positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification result in adults within 3 days of screening regardless of COVID-19 symptoms. INTERVENTION: Treatment was 7 days of oral camostat mesylate, 200 mg po four times a day, or placebo. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was reduction of 4-day log(10) nasopharyngeal swab viral load by 0.5 log(10) compared to placebo. The main prespecified secondary outcome was reduction in symptom scores as measured by a quantitative Likert scale instrument, Flu-PRO-Plus modified to measure changes in smell/taste measured using FLU-PRO-Plus. RESULTS: Participants receiving camostat had statistically significant lower quantitative symptom scores (FLU-Pro-Plus) at day 6, accelerated overall symptom resolution and notably improved taste/smell, and fatigue beginning at onset of intervention in the camostat mesylate group compared to placebo. Intention-to-treat analysis demonstrated that camostat mesylate was not associated with a reduction in 4-day log(10) NP viral load compared to placebo. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The camostat group had more rapid resolution of COVID-19 symptoms and amelioration of the loss of taste and smell. Camostat compared to placebo was not associated with reduction in nasopharyngeal SARS-COV-2 viral load. Additional clinical trials are warranted to validate the role of camostat mesylate on SARS-CoV-2 infection in the treatment of mild COVID-19.

METHODS: We did a randomised, open-label, controlled trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of heterologous boost immunisation with an orally administered aerosolised adenovirus type-5 vector-based COVID-19 vaccine (Ad5-nCoV) in Chinese adults (≥18 years old) who had previously received two doses of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine—Sinovac CoronaVac. Eligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive a heterologous booster vaccination with a low dose (1·0 × 10(11) viral particles per mL; 0·1 mL; low dose group), or a high dose (1·0 × 10(11) viral particles per mL; 0·2 mL; high dose group) aerosolised Ad5-nCoV, or a homologous intramuscular vaccination with CoronaVac (0·5 mL). Only laboratory staff were masked to group assignment. The primary endpoint for safety was the incidence of adverse reactions within 14 days after the booster dose. The primary endpoint for immunogenicity was the geometric mean titres (GMTs) of serum neutralising antibodies (NAbs) against live SARS-CoV-2 virus 14 days after the booster dose. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05043259. FINDINGS: Between Sept 14 and 16, 2021, 420 participants were enrolled: 140 (33%) participants per group. Adverse reactions were reported by 26 (19%) participants in the low dose group and 33 (24%) in the high dose group within 14 days after the booster vaccination, significantly less than the 54 (39%) participants in the CoronaVac group (p<0·0001). The low dose group had a serum NAb GMT of 744·4 (95% CI 520·1–1065·6) and the high dose group had a GMT of 714·1 (479·4–1063·7) 14 days after booster dose, significantly higher than the GMT in the CoronaVac group (78·5 [60·5–101·7]; p<0·0001). INTERPRETATION: We found that a heterologous booster vaccine with an orally administered aerosolised Ad5-nCoV is safe and highly immunogenic in adults who have previously received two doses of CoronaVac as the primary series vaccination.

The management of MFWs is complex and challenging. MFWs are often mistaken for infectious processes/abscesses and treated indiscriminately with oral or intravenous antibiotics. Our aim is to promote awareness of MFWs and provide education on their management. We summarize their cost-effective and evidence-based therapies and highlight antibiotic stewardship with respect to their management. DATA SOURCES: A literature review was performed of PubMed, Cochrane Review, SCOPUS, Embase, and Google Scholar databases regarding topical and systemic treatments for MFWs. REVIEW METHODS: Full-text articles were identified with the following terms: fungating, ulcerative, wound, tumor, malignancy, antibiotics, topical, dressings, radiotherapy, head, neck, scalp, face, lip, and ear. Treatment recommendations were extrapolated, categorically summarized, and retrospectively assigned with an evidence level based on the GRADE system (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation). CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of systemic signs and symptoms of infections, MFWs should not be treated as conventional infections or abscesses, with prophylactic oral or intravenous antibiotics. Topical treatments such as ointments and wound dressings are the mainstay in terms of managing the unsightly appearance and fetid odor from these entities. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: MFWs are most often not amenable to definitive/curative surgical or nonsurgical therapy, but consultation with a head and neck oncologic specialist will help to determine if the underlying malignancy requires surgery, radiation therapy, or palliative treatment.', '[TITLE]: Effect of passive antibodies derived from rotavirus-like particles on neonatal calf diarrhea caused by rotavirus in an oral challenge model [AUTHORS]: Bristol, L.S.; Duhamel, G.E.; Zinckgraf, J.W.; Crabb, J.H.; Nydam, D.V. [JOURNAL]: J Dairy Sci [ABSTRACT]: Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy of bovine rotavirus antigen-specific passive antibody for reducing the duration of diarrhea induced by oral challenge with bovine rotavirus in a neonatal calf model. The bovine rotavirus-specific passive antibodies were produced before the study by hyperimmunization of pregnant cows during the dry period with an adjuvanted vaccine containing recombinantly-expressed rotavirus virus-like particles. Eighty-three calves were cleanly collected at birth and randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups as follows: (1) control group that was colostrum deprived and fed milk replacer for first feeding, (2) group that was colostrum deprived and fed milk replacer mixed with antirotavirus antibodies for first feeding, or (3) group that was fed colostrum replacer mixed with antirotavirus antibodies and a product approved by the US Department of Agriculture containing antibodies against Escherichia coli K99 and bovine coronavirus for first feeding. One of the 3 treatments was administered within 6 h of birth to each calf, followed by oral challenge with bovine rotavirus 3 h later. Calves were observed through 7 d of age and scored according to a standardized scale for clinical signs of diarrhea, change in appetite, depression, and dehydration. Twice daily, measurements of rectal temperature and collection of feces were performed. Fecal samples were assessed for infectious agents commonly associated with diarrhea, and bovine rotavirus shedding was quantified. There were 24 of 28 (86%) calves in the control group that received no antibodies that had signs of severe diarrhea, whereas 57% of the calves that received antirotavirus in milk replacer experienced severe diarrhea, and 7% of calves that received colostrum replacer mixed with antigen-specific bovine rotavirus antibodies showed signs of severe diarrhea. Calves that received colostrum replacer mixed with antigen-specific bovine rotavirus antibodies had a mean duration of 0.9 d of diarrhea compared with 2.7 d in the control group. Calves in the group that was colostrum deprived and fed milk replacer with antirotavirus antibodies had a mean duration of diarrhea of 1.7 d. Rotavirus peak fecal shedding was 3.5 d in the group with milk replacer only, 5.5 d in the milk replacer with antibody group, and 6.5 d in calves in the colostrum replacer group. When bovine rotavirus antigen-specific antibody was fed in milk replacer to colostrum-deprived calves or in conjunction with colostrum replacer that also contained supplemental antibodies against Escherichia coli K99 and bovine coronavirus, those calves were observed to have reduced the onset, duration, and severity of diarrhea when compared with milk replacer placebo.', '[TITLE]: Covid‐19 vaccine induced Steven‐Johnson syndrome: a case report [AUTHORS]: Dash, S.; Sirka, C.S.; Mishra, S.; Viswan, P.

Oral Tablet Vaccination Induces Heightened Cross-Reactive CD8 T Cell Responses to SARS-COV-2 in Humans [AUTHORS]: Johnson, Susan; Martinez, Clarissa; Cortese, Mario; Martinez, Josefina; Garg, Shaily; Peinovich, Nadine; Dora, Emery; Tucker, Sean [JOURNAL]: Open Forum Infect Dis [ABSTRACT]: BACKGROUND: Covid-19 has accelerated global demand for easily distributed vaccines. Furthermore, as variant SARS-CoV-2 strains that circumvent antibody responses emerge, cross-protective vaccines provide substantial public health benefits. Vaxart is developing a shelf stable oral tablet vaccine that incorporates both the spike (S) and the more conserved nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Vaxart’s vaccine platform uses a non-replicating adenovirus and a TLR3 agonist as an adjuvant. METHODS: In an open-label phase 1 clinical study, 35 healthy subjects received either a single low (1x10(10) IU; n=15) or high (5x10(10) IU; n=15) dose of the vaccine candidate VXA-CoV2-1 with a small cohort receiving 2 low doses. PBMCs were taken at pre- and 7 days post-vaccination and restimulated with S and N peptides from SARS-CoV-2 or the 4 human endemic coronaviruses (HCoV). Cells were stained for CD4/CD8/CD107a (surface) and IFNγ/TNFα (intracellular). Subjects that received an intramuscular (i.m.) mRNA vaccine had PBMCs taken at the same timepoints and were compared in the same assay. RESULTS: The study’s results indicate that the VXA-CoV2-1 tablet was well tolerated. The majority of subjects had an increase in S-specific anti-viral CD8(+) T cell responses. 19/26 (73%) subjects had a measurable CD8(+) T cell response on day 8 above baseline, on average 1.5-4.6%. In a comparator experiment with the 2 SARS-CoV-2 i.m. mRNA vaccines, VXA-CoV2-1 outperformed other vaccine candidates with a >3.5-fold increase in S specific antiviral CD8 T cell responses. T cell responses specific to the 4 endemic HCoV were increased by 0.6% in subjects given VXA-CoV2-1. CONCLUSION: Here we describe a room temperature stable tablet that induces SARS-CoV-2 S specific CD8 T cells of high magnitude after one dose in humans. Overall, the level of antiviral SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells, particularly IFNg-producing CD8s, induced following oral immunization with VXA-CoV2-1 are of higher magnitude than the mRNA vaccines currently in use against COVID-19. T cell responses against 4 endemic HCoV were also induced. Because T cells may be important in protecting against death and severe infection, these results suggest that VXA-CoV2-1 could be cross-protective against a wide array of emerging pandemic coronaviruses.

Adult male Sprague Dawley rats were intraperitoneally injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (10 mg/kg), followed by MLT (30 mg/kg/day) or saline for 3 days. Hypothalamic tissues and skeletal muscle were obtained on day 3. Skeletal muscle wasting was measured by the mRNA expression of two E3 ubiquitin ligases, muscle atrophy F-box and muscle ring finger 1 as well as 3-methylhistidine (3-MH) and tyrosine release. Three hypothalamic neuropeptides (POMC, AgRP, CART) expression were detected in all groups. POMC expression knockdown was achieved by ARC injection of lentiviruses containing shRNA against POMC. Two weeks after ARC viruses injection, rats were i.p. injected with LPS (10 mg/kg) followed by MLT (30 mg/kg/day) or saline for 3 days. Brain tissues were harvested for immunostaining. In septic rats, 3-MH, tyrosine release and muscle atrophic gene expression were significantly decreased in MLT treated group. POMC and CART expression were lower while AgRP expression was higher in MLT treated group. Furthermore, in septic rats treated with MLT, muscle wasting in those with lower expression of neuropeptide POMC did not differ from those with normal POMC expression. Exogenous MLT could alleviate skeletal muscle wasting in septic rats by regulating hypothalamic neuropeptides.', '[TITLE]: Phage therapy as a revolutionary medicine against Gram-positive bacterial infections [AUTHORS]: Loganathan, Archana; Manohar, Prasanth; Eniyan, Kandasamy; VinodKumar, C. S.; Leptihn, Sebastian; Nachimuthu, Ramesh [JOURNAL]: Beni Suef Univ J Basic Appl Sci [ABSTRACT]: BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistance among pathogenic bacteria has created a global emergency, prompting the hunt for an alternative cure. Bacteriophages were discovered over a century ago and have proven to be a successful replacement during antibiotic treatment failure. This review discusses on the scientific investigation of phage therapy for Gram-positive pathogens and general outlook of phage therapy clinical trials and commercialization. MAIN BODY OF THE ABSTRACT: This review aimed to highlight the phage therapy in Gram-positive bacteria and the need for phage therapy in the future. Phage therapy to treat Gram-positive bacterial infections is in use for a very long time. However, limited review on the phage efficacy in Gram-positive bacteria exists. The natural efficiency and potency of bacteriophages against bacterial strains have been advantageous amidst the other non-antibiotic agents. The use of phages to treat oral biofilm, skin infection, and recurrent infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria has emerged as a predominant research area in recent years. In addition, the upsurge in research in the area of phage therapy for spore-forming Gram-positive bacteria has added a wealth of information to phage therapy. SHORT CONCLUSION: We conclude that the need of phage as an alternative treatment is obvious in future. However, phage therapy can be used as reserve treatment. This review focuses on the potential use of phage therapy in treating Gram-positive bacterial infections, as well as their therapeutic aspects. Furthermore, we discussed the difficulties in commercializing phage drugs and their problems as a breakthrough medicine.', '[TITLE]: Direct oral anticoagulant plasma levels’ striking increase in severe COVID‐19 respiratory syndrome patients treated with antiviral agents: The Cremona experience [AUTHORS]: Testa, Sophie; Prandoni, Paolo; Paoletti, Oriana; Morandini, Rossella; Tala, Maurizio; Dellanoce, Claudia; Giorgi‐Pierfranceschi, Matteo; Betti, Monia; Battista Danzi, Gian; Pan, Angelo; Palareti, Gualtiero [JOURNAL]: J Thromb Haemost [ABSTRACT]: BACKGROUND: Antiviral drugs are administered in patients with severe COVID‐19 respiratory syndrome, including those treated with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Concomitant administration of antiviral agents has the potential to increase their plasma concentration. A series of patients managed in the Cremona Thrombosis Center were admitted at Cremona Hospital for SARS‐CoV‐2 and started antiviral drugs without stopping DOAC therapy. DOAC plasma levels were measured in hospital and results compared with those recorded before hospitalization. METHODS: All consecutive patients on DOACs were candidates for administration of antiviral agents (lopinavir, ritonavir, or darunavir). Plasma samples for DOAC measurement were collected 2to 4 days after starting antiviral treatment, at 12 hours from the last dose intake in patients on dabigatran and apixaban, and at 24 hours in those on rivaroxaban and edoxaban. For each patient, C‐trough DOAC level, expressed as ng/mL, was compared with the one measured before hospitalization. RESULTS: Of the 1039 patients hospitalized between February 22 and March 15, 2020 with COVID‐19 pneumonia and candidates for antiviral therapy, 32 were on treatment with a DOAC. DOAC was stopped in 20 and continued in the remaining 12. On average, C‐trough levels were 6.14 times higher during hospitalization than in the pre‐hospitalization period. CONCLUSION: DOAC patients treated with antiviral drugs show an alarming increase in DOAC plasma levels. In order to prevent bleeding complications, we believe that physicians should consider withholding DOACs from patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 and replacing them with alternative parenteral antithrombotic strategies for as long as antiviral agents are deemed necessary and until discharge.', '[TITLE]: Inter-and Intraindividual Concentrations of Direct Oral Anticoagulants: The KIDOAC study. [AUTHORS]: Toorop, Myrthe M A; van Rein, Nienke; Nierman, Melchior C; Vermaas, Helga W; Huisman, Menno V; van der Meer, Felix J M; Cannegieter, Suzanne C; Lijfering, Willem M [JOURNAL]: Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH [ABSTRACT]: BACKGROUND Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) do not require concentration monitoring. However, whether DOAC concentrations are stable and their variation between and within patients is not well studied. METHODS Patients on vitamin K antagonists (VKA) who switched to rivaroxaban, apixaban, or dabigatran were included between 2018-2020. Blood was drawn at DOAC trough and peak concentrations at week 0, 2 and 8. Plasma drug concentrations were determined by anti-factor Xa concentrations (rivaroxaban, apixaban) or diluted thrombin time (dabigatran). Inter-and intra-individual variability was assessed by calculating the coefficient of variation (CV). Linear regression models were employed to evaluate associations between DOAC trough concentrations and creatinine clearance, previous VKA dosage, and body mass index (BMI). RESULTS 152 patients were included, of whom 96 (63%) male and with a mean age of 73.9±8.4 years. For the inter-individual variability, the CV ranged between 48-81% for trough values and between 25-69% for peak values among patients using the recommended DOAC dose. Intra-individual variability was substantially lower, as here the CV ranged between 18-33% for trough values and between 15-29% for peak values among patients using the recommended DOAC dose. Previous VKA dosage and creatinine clearance were inversely correlated with DOAC trough concentrations. No correlation was found between BMI and DOAC trough concentrations. CONCLUSION Inter-individual variability of DOAC concentration was higher than intra-individual variability. Creatinine clearance and previous VKA dosage were associated with higher DOAC trough concentrations. These findings support further study into an optimal target range, in which the risks of both bleeding and thrombosis are minimal.', '[TITLE]: Higher viral loads in asymptomatic COVID-19 patients might be the invisible part of the iceberg [AUTHORS]: Hasanoglu, Imran; Korukluoglu, Gulay; Asilturk, Dilek; Cosgun, Yasemin; Kalem, Ayse Kaya; Altas, Ayşe Basak; Kayaaslan, Bircan; Eser, Fatma; Kuzucu, Esra Akkan; Guner, Rahmet [JOURNAL]: Infection [ABSTRACT]: PURPOSE: SARS-CoV-2 virus dynamics in different hosts and different samples and their relationship with disease severity have not been clearly revealed. The aim of this study is to evaluate the viral loads of 6 different sample types (nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal combined, oral cavity, saliva, rectal, urine, and blood) of patients with different ages and clinics, to reveal the relationship between disease course and SARS-CoV-2 viral load, and differences in viral loads of asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal, oral cavity, saliva, rectal, urine, and blood samples are collected from patients who were hospitalized with diagnosis of COVID-19 on admission. Laboratory analysis were carried out at Public Health Institute of Turkey Virology Reference and Research Laboratory. RESULTS: A total of 360 samples from 60 patients were obtained on admission. Fifteen (25%) of the patients were asymptomatic while 45 (75%) were symptomatic. A significant difference was found between mean ages of asymptomatic vs symptomatic patients (26.4 and 36.4, respectively, p = 0.0248). No PCR positivity were found in blood. Only one asymptomatic patient had positive PCR result for urine sample. Viral loads of asymptomatic patients were found to be significantly higher (p = 0.0141) when compared with symptomatic patients. Viral load had a significant negative trend with increasing age. A significant decrease in viral load was observed with increasing disease severity. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this study demonstrates that asymptomatic patients have higher SARSCoV-2 viral loads than symptomatic patients and unlike in the few study in the literature, a significant decrease in viral load of nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal samples was observed with increasing disease severity. Factors associated with poor prognosis are found to be significantly correlated with low viral load.', '[TITLE]: COVID-19: patient characteristics in the first phase of post-intensive care rehabilitation [AUTHORS]: Wiertz, Carolina M.H.; Vints, Wouter A.J.; Maas, Geert.

[JOURNAL]: Arch Rehabil Res Clin Transl [ABSTRACT]: Objective To describe clinical characteristics of post-ICU COVID-19 patients, admitted for inpatient rehabilitation. Design A cross-sectional design Setting Inpatient rehabilitation care in the Netherlands Participants All post-ICU COVID-19 patients admitted to the rehabilitation centre between April 2 and May 13, 2020 were invited to participate in the study. Included were patients above 18 years old, needing inpatient rehabilitation after ICU treatment for COVID-19. Intervention Not applicable Main outcomes measures The following information was collected in the first week of inpatient rehabilitation care: 1. Demographics, 2. ICU-stay parameters, 3. Medical, physical and functional characteristics, 4. Self-reported symptoms. Results Sixty patients participated with the mean age of 59.9 and the majority being men(75%). Most important findings for rehabilitation: in the first week after discharge to the rehabilitation centre 38.3% of all patients experienced exercise-induced oxygen desaturation, in 72.7% muscle weakness was present in all major muscle groups and 21.7% had a reduced mobility in one or both shoulders. Furthermore 40% suffered from dysphagia and 39.2% reported symptoms of anxiety. Conclusion Post-ICU COVID-19 patients, display physical and anxiety symptoms as reported in other post-ICU patient groups. However this study showed some remarkable clinical characteristics of post-ICU COVID-19 patients. Rehabilitation programs need to anticipate on this. Long-term follow-up studies are necessary.', '[TITLE]: Therapeutic versus prophylactic anticoagulation for patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 and elevated D-dimer concentration (ACTION): an open-label, multicentre, randomised, controlled trial [AUTHORS]: Lopes, Renato D; de Barros e Silva, Pedro Gabriel Melo; Furtado, Remo H M; Macedo, Ariane Vieira Scarlatelli; Bronhara, Bruna; Damiani, Lucas Petri; Barbosa, Lilian Mazza; de Aveiro Morata, Júlia; Ramacciotti, Eduardo; de Aquino Martins, Priscilla; de Oliveira, Aryadne Lyrio; Nunes, Vinicius Santana; Ritt, Luiz Eduardo Fonteles; Rocha, Ana Thereza; Tramujas, Lucas; Santos, Sueli V; Diaz, Dario Rafael Abregu; Viana, Lorena Souza; Melro, Lívia Maria Garcia; de Alcântara Chaud, Mariana Silveira; Figueiredo, Estêvão Lanna; Neuenschwander, Fernando Carvalho; Dracoulakis, Marianna Deway Andrade; Lima, Rodolfo Godinho Souza Dourado; de Souza Dantas, Vicente Cés; Fernandes, Anne Cristine Silva; Gebara, Otávio Celso Eluf; Hernandes, Mauro Esteves; Queiroz, Diego Aparecido Rios; Veiga, Viviane C; Canesin, Manoel Fernandes; de Faria, Leonardo Meira; Feitosa-Filho, Gilson Soares; Gazzana, Marcelo Basso; Liporace, Idelzuíta Leandro; de Oliveira Twardowsky, Aline; Maia, Lilia Nigro; Machado, Flávia Ribeiro; de Matos Soeiro, Alexandre; Conceição-Souza, Germano Emílio; Armaganijan, Luciana; Guimarães, Patrícia O; Rosa, Regis G; Azevedo, Luciano C P; Alexander, John H; Avezum, Alvaro; Cavalcanti, Alexandre B; Berwanger, Otavio [JOURNAL]: Lancet [ABSTRACT]: BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is associated with a prothrombotic state leading to adverse clinical outcomes. Whether therapeutic anticoagulation improves outcomes in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 is unknown. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of therapeutic versus prophylactic anticoagulation in this population. METHODS: We did a pragmatic, open-label (with blinded adjudication), multicentre, randomised, controlled trial, at 31 sites in Brazil. Patients (aged ≥18 years) hospitalised with COVID-19 and elevated D-dimer concentration, and who had COVID-19 symptoms for up to 14 days before randomisation, were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either therapeutic or prophylactic anticoagulation. Therapeutic anticoagulation was in-hospital oral rivaroxaban (20 mg or 15 mg daily) for stable patients, or initial subcutaneous enoxaparin (1 mg/kg twice per day) or intravenous unfractionated heparin (to achieve a 0·3–0·7 IU/mL anti-Xa concentration) for clinically unstable patients, followed by rivaroxaban to day 30. Prophylactic anticoagulation was standard in-hospital enoxaparin or unfractionated heparin. The primary efficacy outcome was a hierarchical analysis of time to death, duration of hospitalisation, or duration of supplemental oxygen to day 30, analysed with the win ratio method (a ratio >1 reflects a better outcome in the therapeutic anticoagulation group) in the intention-to-treat population. The primary safety outcome was major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding through 30 days. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04394377) and is completed. FINDINGS: From June 24, 2020, to Feb 26, 2021, 3331 patients were screened and 615 were randomly allocated (311 [50%] to the therapeutic anticoagulation group and 304 [50%] to the prophylactic anticoagulation group). 576 (94%) were clinically stable and 39 (6%) clinically unstable. One patient, in the therapeutic group, was lost to follow-up because of withdrawal of consent and was not included in the primary analysis. The primary efficacy outcome was not different between patients assigned therapeutic or prophylactic anticoagulation, with 28 899 (34·8%) wins in the therapeutic group and 34 288 (41·3%) in the prophylactic group (win ratio 0·86 [95% CI 0·59–1·22], p=0·40). Consistent results were seen in clinically stable and clinically unstable patients. The primary safety outcome of major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding occurred in 26 (8%) patients assigned therapeutic anticoagulation and seven (2%) assigned prophylactic anticoagulation (relative risk 3·64 [95% CI 1·61–8·27], p=0·0010). Allergic reaction to the study medication occurred in two (1%) patients in the therapeutic anticoagulation group and three (1%) in the prophylactic anticoagulation group. INTERPRETATION: In patients hospitalised with COVID-19 and elevated D-dimer concentration, in-hospital therapeutic anticoagulation with rivaroxaban or enoxaparin followed by rivaroxaban to day 30 did not improve clinical outcomes and increased bleeding compared with prophylactic anticoagulation. Therefore, use of therapeutic-dose rivaroxaban, and other direct oral anticoagulants, should be avoided in these patients in the absence of an evidence-based indication for oral anticoagulation.

E.; Hirsch, R. R.; Farinella, M. E. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: From the first outbreak in Wuhan (China) in December 2019, until today the number of deaths worldwide due to the coronavirus pandemic exceeds eight hundred thousand people and the number of infected people arises to more than 25 million. No treatment tested worldwide has shown unquestionable efficacy in the fight against COVID 19, according to NICE reports. We have designed an experimental treatment called IDEA based on four affordable drugs already available on the market in Argentina, based on the following rationale: -Ivermectin solution at a relatively high dose to lower the viral load in all stages of COVID 19 -Dexamethasone 4-mg injection, as anti-inflammatory drug to treat hyperinflammatory reaction to COVID-infection -Enoxaparin injection as anticoagulant to treat hypercoagulation in severe cases. -Aspirin 250-mg tablets to prevent hypercoagulation in mild and moderate cases Except for Ivermection oral solution, which was used in a higher dose than approved for parasitosis, all other drugs were used in the already approved dose and indication. Regarding Ivermectin safety, several oral studies have shown it to be safe even when used at daily doses much higher than those approved already. A clinical study has been conducted on COVID-19 patients at Eurnekian Hospital in the Province of Buenos Aires, Argentina. The study protocol and its final outcomes are described in this article. Results were compared with published data and data from patients admitted to the hospital receiving other treatments. None of the patient presenting mild symptoms needed to be hospitalized. Only one patient died (0.59 % of all included patients vs. 2.1 % overall mortality for the disease in Argentina today; 3.1 % of hospitalized patients vs. 26.8 % mortality in published data). IDEA protocol appears to be a useful alternative to prevent disease progression of COVID-19 when applied to mild cases and to decrease mortality in patients at all stages of the disease with a favorable risk-benefit ratio.', '[TITLE]: Panuveitis following Vaccination for COVID-19 [AUTHORS]: Mudie, Lucy I; Zick, Jon D; Dacey, Mark S; Palestine, Alan G [JOURNAL]: Ocul Immunol Inflamm [ABSTRACT]: Background: COVID-19 vaccination has been accompanied by reports of inflammatory events.

Several vaccines were approved for use by emergency vaccination campaigns worldwide. At present, there are very few reports of COVID-19 vaccine-induced immune-thrombotic thrombocytopenia, a variant of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), in comparison to the massive number of vaccinated people worldwide. CASE REPORT: A 59-year-old woman presented to the Emergency Department with a 3-day history of sudden-onset left leg pain 7 days after receiving her first dose of BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 (Pfizer-BioNTech). She was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) and found to have a positive HIT screen with optical density (OD) of 0.6 via ELISA test. She was hospitalized for 4 days and discharged home with an oral anticoagulant (rivaroxaban). CONCLUSIONS: This case report describes a possible link between BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccination and thromboembolism. However, further data are needed to support such an association.', '[TITLE]: Oral famotidine versus placebo in non-hospitalised patients with COVID-19: a randomised, double-blind, data-intense, phase 2 clinical trial [AUTHORS]: Brennan, Christina M; Nadella, Sandeep; Zhao, Xiang; Dima, Richard J; Jordan-Martin, Nicole; Demestichas, Breanna R; Kleeman, Sam O; Ferrer, Miriam; von Gablenz, Eva Carlotta; Mourikis, Nicholas; Rubin, Michael E; Adnani, Harsha; Lee, Hassal; Ha, Taehoon; Prum, Soma; Schleicher, Cheryl B; Fox, Sharon S; Ryan, Michael G; Pili, Christina; Goldberg, Gary; Crawford, James M; Goodwin, Sara; Zhang, Xiaoyue; Preall, Jonathan B; Costa, Ana S H; Conigliaro, Joseph; Masci, Joseph R; Yang, Jie; Tuveson, David A; Tracey, Kevin J; Janowitz, Tobias [JOURNAL]: Gut [ABSTRACT]: OBJECTIVE: We assessed whether famotidine improved inflammation and symptomatic recovery in outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19. DESIGN: Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fully remote, phase 2 clinical trial (NCT04724720) enrolling symptomatic unvaccinated adult outpatients with confirmed COVID-19 between January 2021 and April 2021 from two US centres. Patients self-administered 80 mg famotidine (n=28) or placebo (n=27) orally three times a day for 14 consecutive days. Endpoints were time to (primary) or rate of (secondary) symptom resolution, and resolution of inflammation (exploratory). RESULTS: Of 55 patients in the intention-to-treat group (median age 35 years (IQR: 20); 35 women (64%); 18 African American (33%); 14 Hispanic (26%)), 52 (95%) completed the trial, submitting 1358 electronic symptom surveys. Time to symptom resolution was not statistically improved (p=0.4). Rate of symptom resolution was improved for patients taking famotidine (p<0.0001). Estimated 50% reduction of overall baseline symptom scores were achieved at 8.2 days (95% CI: 7 to 9.8 days) for famotidine and 11.4 days (95% CI: 10.3 to 12.6 days) for placebo treated patients. Differences were independent of patient sex, race or ethnicity. Five self-limiting adverse events occurred (famotidine, n=2 (40%); placebo, n=3 (60%)). On day 7, fewer patients on famotidine had detectable interferon alpha plasma levels (p=0.04). Plasma immunoglobulin type G levels to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid core protein were similar between both arms. CONCLUSIONS: Famotidine was safe and well tolerated in outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Famotidine led to earlier resolution of symptoms and inflammation without reducing anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity. Additional randomised trials are required.', '[TITLE]: Outcomes of 3,737 COVID-19 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin and other regimens in Marseille, France: A retrospective analysis [AUTHORS]: Lagier, Jean-Christophe; Million, Matthieu; Gautret, Philippe; Colson, Philippe; Cortaredona, Sébastien; Giraud-Gatineau, Audrey; Honoré, Stéphane; Gaubert, Jean-Yves; Fournier, Pierre-Edouard; Tissot-Dupont, Hervé; Chabrière, Eric; Stein, Andreas; Deharo, Jean-Claude; Fenollar, Florence; Rolain, Jean-Marc; Obadia, Yolande; Jacquier, Alexis; La Scola, Bernard; Brouqui, Philippe; Drancourt, Michel; Parola, Philippe; Raoult, Didier [JOURNAL]: Travel Med Infect Dis [ABSTRACT]: BACKGROUND: In our institute in Marseille, France, we initiated early and massive screening for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Hospitalization and early treatment with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin (HCQ-AZ) was proposed for the positive cases. METHODS: We retrospectively report the clinical management of 3,737 screened patients, including 3,119 (83.5%) treated with HCQ-AZ (200 mg of oral HCQ, three times daily for ten days and 500 mg of oral AZ on day 1 followed by 250 mg daily for the next four days, respectively) for at least three days and 618 (16.5%) patients treated with other regimen (“others”). Outcomes were death, transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU), ≥10 days of hospitalization and viral shedding. RESULTS: The patients’ mean age was 45 (sd 17) years, 45% were male, and the case fatality rate was 0.9%. We performed 2,065 low-dose computed tomography (CT) scans highlighting lung lesions in 592 of the 991 (59.7%) patients with minimal clinical symptoms (NEWS score = 0). A discrepancy between spontaneous dyspnoea, hypoxemia and lung lesions was observed. Clinical factors (age, comorbidities, NEWS-2 score), biological factors (lymphocytopenia; eosinopenia; decrease in blood zinc; and increase in D-dimers, lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine phosphokinase, and C-reactive protein) and moderate and severe lesions detected in low-dose CT scans were associated with poor clinical outcome. Treatment with HCQ-AZ was associated with a decreased risk of transfer to ICU or death (Hazard ratio (HR) 0.18 0.11–0.27), decreased risk of hospitalization ≥10 days (odds ratios 95% CI 0.38 0.27–0.54) and shorter duration of viral shedding (time to negative PCR: HR 1.29 1.17–1.42). QTc prolongation (>60 ms) was observed in 25 patients (0.67%) leading to the cessation of treatment in 12 cases including 3 cases with QTc> 500 ms. No cases of torsade de pointe or sudden death were observed. CONCLUSION: Although this is a retrospective analysis, results suggest that early diagnosis, early isolation and early treatment of COVID-19 patients, with at least 3 days of HCQ-AZ lead to a significantly better clinical outcome and a faster viral load reduction than other treatments.', '[TITLE]: The airborne lifetime of small speech droplets and their potential importance in SARS-CoV-2 transmission [AUTHORS]: Stadnytskyi, Valentyn; Bax, Christina E.; Bax, Adriaan; Anfinrud, Philip [JOURNAL]: Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A [ABSTRACT]: Speech droplets generated by asymptomatic carriers of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are increasingly considered to be a likely mode of disease transmission. Highly sensitive laser light scattering observations have revealed that loud speech can emit thousands of oral fluid droplets per second. In a closed, stagnant air environment, they disappear from the window of view with time constants in the range of 8 to 14 min, which corresponds to droplet nuclei of ca. 4 μm diameter, or 12- to 21-μm droplets prior to dehydration. These observations confirm that there is a substantial probability that normal speaking causes airborne virus transmission in confined environments.', '[TITLE]: Low Concentrations of Chlorhexidine Inhibit the Formation and Structural Integrity of Enzyme-Treated Multispecies Oral Biofilms [AUTHORS]: Gränicher, Kay Andrin; Karygianni, Lamprini; Attin, Thomas; Thurnheer, Thomas [JOURNAL]: Front Microbiol [ABSTRACT]: The self-produced matrix of biofilms, consisting of extracellular polymeric substances, plays an important role in biofilm adhesion to surfaces and the structural integrity of biofilms. In dentistry, biofilms cause multiple diseases such as caries, periodontitis, and pulpitis. Disruption of these biofilms adhering to dental hard tissues may pose a major challenge since biofilms show higher tolerance to antimicrobials and antibiotics than planktonic cells. In this study, the effect of low concentrations of chlorhexidine (CHX) on enzyme-treated multispecies oral biofilm was investigated in an in vitro model. Six-species biofilms were enzymatically treated by anaerobic growth in a medium containing DNase I and proteinase K. Biofilms were exposed to a low concentration of CHX at defined time points. After 64h, biofilms were either harvested and quantified by cultural analyses or stained for confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) analyses using either Live/Dead kit or different fluorescent dyes. A mixture of YoPro1 and SYTOX(™) Green, Fluorescent Brightener 28 (Calcofluor), and SYPRO(™) Ruby Protein Gel Stain was used to stain total DNA, exopolysaccharides, and extracellular proteins, respectively. Extracellular DNA (eDNA) was visualized via an indirect immunofluorescence assay (Mouse anti-DNA IgG, Goat anti-Mouse IgG, Streptavidin-Cy3). Overall, the total colony-forming units significantly decreased after combined treatment with a low concentration of CHX and enzymes compared to the group treated with CHX alone (p<0.001). These findings also apply to five species individually (Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Actinomyces oris, Veillonella dispar, and Candida albicans) occurring in the biofilms, with Fusobacterium nucleatum being the only exception. Furthermore, CLSM images showed less dense biofilms and a reduction in cell numbers after combined treatment compared to the group without enzymes. The combination of enzymes capable of disturbing the matrix integrity with antimicrobial agents thus appears to be a promising approach for biofilm disruption and killing.', '[TITLE]: TREM2 is thyroid hormone regulated making the TREM2 pathway druggable with ligands for thyroid hormone receptor [AUTHORS]: Ferrara, Skylar J; Chaudhary, Priya; DeBell, Margaret J; Marracci, Gail; Miller, Hannah; Calkins, Evan; Pocius, Edvinas; Napier, Brooke A; Emery, Ben; Bourdette, Dennis; Scanlan, Thomas S [JOURNAL]: Cell Chem. Biol [ABSTRACT]: Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (TREM2) is a cell surface receptor on macrophages and microglia that senses and responds to disease-associated signals to regulate the phenotype of these innate immune cells. The TREM2 signaling pathway has been implicated in a variety of diseases ranging from neurodegeneration in the central nervous system to metabolic disease in the periphery. Here, we report that TREM2 is a thyroid hormone-regulated gene and its expression in macrophages and microglia is stimulated by thyroid hormone and synthetic thyroid hormone agonists (thyromimetics). Our findings report the endocrine regulation of TREM2 by thyroid hormone, and provide a unique opportunity to drug the TREM2 signaling pathway with orally active small-molecule therapeutic agents.', '[TITLE]: Early rehabilitation during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has minimal impact on physiological parameters: A pilot randomised controlled trial [AUTHORS]: Hayes, K; Holland, A E; Pellegrino, V A; Young, M; Paul, E; Hodgson, C L [JOURNAL]: Aust Crit Care [ABSTRACT]: BACKGROUND: Patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) often require prolonged periods of bed rest owing to their severity of illness along with the care required to maintain the position and integrity of the ECMO cannula. Many patients on ECMO receive passive exercises, and rehabilitation is often delayed owing to medical instability, with a high proportion of patients demonstrating severe muscle weakness. The physiological effects of an intensive rehabilitation program started early after ECMO commencement remain unknown. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study was to describe the respiratory and haemodynamic effects of early intensive rehabilitation compared with standard care physiotherapy over a 7-d period in patients requiring ECMO. METHODS: This was a physiological substudy of a multicentre randomised controlled trial conducted in one tertiary referral hospital. Consecutive adult patients undergoing ECMO were recruited. Respiratory and haemodynamic parameters, along with ECMO settings, were recorded 30 min before and after each session and continuously during the session. In addition, the minimum and maximum values for these parameters were recorded outside of the rehabilitation or standard care sessions for each 24-h period over the 7 d. The number of minutes of exercise per session was recorded. RESULTS: Fifteen patients (mean age = 51.5 ± standard deviation of 14.3 y, 80% men) received ECMO. There was no difference between the groups for any of the respiratory, haemodynamic, or ECMO parameters. The minimum and maximum values for each parameter were recorded outside of the rehabilitation or standard care sessions. The intensive rehabilitation group (n = 7) spent more time exercising per session than the standard care group (n = 8) (mean = 28.7 versus 4.2 min, p < 0.0001). Three patients (43%) in the intensive rehabilitation group versus none in the standard care group mobilised out of bed during ECMO. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, early intensive rehabilitation of patients on ECMO had minimal effect on physiological parameters.', '[TITLE]: Short term, high-dose vitamin D supplementation for COVID-19 disease: a randomised, placebo-controlled, study (SHADE study).

AIM Effect of high dose, oral cholecalciferol supplementation on SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance. DESIGN Randomised, placebo-controlled. PARTICIPANTS Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive vitamin D deficient (25(OH)D<20 ng/ml) individuals. INTERVENTION Participants were randomised to receive daily 60 000 IU of cholecalciferol (oral nano-liquid droplets) for 7 days with therapeutic target 25(OH)D>50 ng/ml (intervention group) or placebo (control group). Patients requiring invasive ventilation or with significant comorbidities were excluded. 25(OH)D levels were assessed at day 7, and cholecalciferol supplementation was continued for those with 25(OH)D <50 ng/ml in the intervention arm. SARS-CoV-2 RNA and inflammatory markers fibrinogen, D-dimer, procalcitonin and (CRP), ferritin were measured periodically. OUTCOME MEASURE Proportion of patients with SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative before day-21 and change in inflammatory markers. RESULTS Forty SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive individuals were randomised to intervention (n=16) or control (n=24) group. Baseline serum 25(OH)D was 8.6 (7.1 to 13.1) and 9.54 (8.1 to 12.5) ng/ml (p=0.730), in the intervention and control group, respectively. 10 out of 16 patients could achieve 25(OH)D>50 ng/ml by day-7 and another two by day-14 [day-14 25(OH)D levels 51.7 (48.9 to 59.5) ng/ml and 15.2 (12.7 to 19.5) ng/ml (p<0.001) in intervention and control group, respectively]. 10 (62.5%) participants in the intervention group and 5 (20.8%) participants in the control arm (p<0.018) became SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative. Fibrinogen levels significantly decreased with cholecalciferol supplementation (intergroup difference 0.70 ng/ml; P=0.007) unlike other inflammatory biomarkers. CONCLUSION Greater proportion of vitamin D-deficient individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection turned SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative with a significant decrease in fibrinogen on high-dose cholecalciferol supplementation.

Objective: To assess whether anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy can safely reduce major adverse cardiopulmonary outcomes among symptomatic but clinically stable outpatients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: The ACTIV-4B Outpatient Thrombosis Prevention Trial was designed as a minimal-contact, adaptive, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to compare anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy among 7000 symptomatic but clinically stable outpatients with COVID-19. The trial was conducted at 52 US sites between September 2020 and June 2021; final follow-up was August 5, 2021. Prior to initiating treatment, participants were required to have platelet count greater than 100â\\x80¯000/mm3 and estimated glomerular filtration rate greater than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. Interventions: Random allocation in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to aspirin (81 mg orally once daily; n = 164), prophylactic-dose apixaban (2.5 mg orally twice daily; n = 165), therapeutic-dose apixaban (5 mg orally twice daily; n = 164), or placebo (n = 164) for 45 days. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was a composite of all-cause mortality, symptomatic venous or arterial thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, stroke, or hospitalization for cardiovascular or pulmonary cause. The primary analyses for efficacy and bleeding events were limited to participants who took at least 1 dose of trial medication. Results: On June 18, 2021, the trial data and safety monitoring board recommended early termination because of lower than anticipated event rates; at that time, 657 symptomatic outpatients with COVID-19 had been randomized (median age, 54 years [IQR, 46-59]; 59% women). The median times from diagnosis to randomization and from randomization to initiation of study treatment were 7 days and 3 days, respectively. Twenty-two randomized participants (3.3%) were hospitalized for COVID-19 prior to initiating treatment. Among the 558 patients who initiated treatment, the adjudicated primary composite end point occurred in 1 patient (0.7%) in the aspirin group, 1 patient (0.7%) in the 2.5-mg apixaban group, 2 patients (1.4%) in the 5-mg apixaban group, and 1 patient (0.7%) in the placebo group. The risk differences compared with placebo for the primary end point were 0.0% (95% CI not calculable) in the aspirin group, 0.7% (95% CI, -2.1% to 4.1%) in the 2.5-mg apixaban group, and 1.4% (95% CI, -1.5% to 5.0%) in the 5-mg apixaban group. Risk differences compared with placebo for bleeding events were 2.0% (95% CI, -2.7% to 6.8%), 4.5% (95% CI, -0.7% to 10.2%), and 6.9% (95% CI, 1.4% to 12.9%) among participants who initiated therapy in the aspirin, prophylactic apixaban, and therapeutic apixaban groups, respectively, although none were major. Findings inclusive of all randomized patients were similar. Conclusions and Relevance: Among symptomatic clinically stable outpatients with COVID-19, treatment with aspirin or apixaban compared with placebo did not reduce the rate of a composite clinical outcome. However, the study was terminated after enrollment of 9% of participants because of an event rate lower than anticipated.

Thus far there are no proven therapeutic options to treat COVID-19. We report a case of COVID-19 with acute respiratory distress syndrome who was treated with high-dose vitamin C infusion and was the first case to have early recovery from the disease at our institute. CASE REPORT: A 74-year-old woman with no recent sick contacts or travel history presented with fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Her vital signs were normal except for oxygen saturation of 87% and bilateral rhonchi on lung auscultation. Chest radiography revealed air space opacity in the right upper lobe, suspicious for pneumonia. A nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 came back positive while the patient was in the airborne-isolation unit. Laboratory data showed lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, and interleukin-6. The patient was initially started on oral hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. On day 6, she developed ARDS and septic shock, for which mechanical ventilation and pressor support were started, along with infusion of high-dose intravenous vitamin C. The patient improved clinically and was able to be taken off mechanical ventilation within 5 days. CONCLUSIONS: This report highlights the potential benefits of high-dose intravenous vitamin C in critically ill COVID-19 patients in terms of rapid recovery and shortened length of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay. Further studies will elaborate on the efficacy of intravenous vitamin C in critically ill COVID-19.', '[TITLE]: ANCA-associated vasculitis following ChAdOx1 nCoV19 vaccination: case-based review [AUTHORS]: Prabhahar, Arun; Naidu, G.

As the number and fatalities due to COVID-19 decline and the lockdown anywise rescinded, we recognize an increase in the incidence of autoimmune disease post-COVID-19 vaccination. However, the causality of the most vaccine-induced side effects is debatable and, at best, limited to a temporal correlation. We herein report a case of a 51-year-old gentleman who developed Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) 2 week post-COVID-19 vaccination. The patient responded favorably to oral steroids and rituximab. Additionally, we conducted a case-based review of vaccine-associated AAV describing their clinical manifestations and treatment response of this emerging entity.

[JOURNAL]: Am J Ther [ABSTRACT]: After COVID-19 emerged on U.S shores, providers began reviewing the emerging basic science, translational, and clinical data to identify potentially effective treatment options. In addition, a multitude of both novel and repurposed therapeutic agents were used empirically and studied within clinical trials. AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY: The majority of trialed agents have failed to provide reproducible, definitive proof of efficacy in reducing the mortality of COVID-19 with the exception of corticosteroids in moderate to severe disease. Recently, evidence has emerged that the oral antiparasitic agent ivermectin exhibits numerous antiviral and anti-inflammatory mechanisms with trial results reporting significant outcome benefits. Given some have not passed peer review, several expert groups including Unitaid/World Health Organization have undertaken a systematic global effort to contact all active trial investigators to rapidly gather the data needed to grade and perform meta-analyses. DATA SOURCES: Data were sourced from published peer-reviewed studies, manuscripts posted to preprint servers, expert meta-analyses, and numerous epidemiological analyses of regions with ivermectin distribution campaigns. THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES: A large majority of randomized and observational controlled trials of ivermectin are reporting repeated, large magnitude improvements in clinical outcomes. Numerous prophylaxis trials demonstrate that regular ivermectin use leads to large reductions in transmission. Multiple, large “natural experiments” occurred in regions that initiated “ivermectin distribution” campaigns followed by tight, reproducible, temporally associated decreases in case counts and case fatality rates compared with nearby regions without such campaigns. CONCLUSIONS: Meta-analyses based on 18 randomized controlled treatment trials of ivermectin in COVID-19 have found large, statistically significant reductions in mortality, time to clinical recovery, and time to viral clearance. Furthermore, results from numerous controlled prophylaxis trials report significantly reduced risks of contracting COVID-19 with the regular use of ivermectin. Finally, the many examples of ivermectin distribution campaigns leading to rapid population-wide decreases in morbidity and mortality indicate that an oral agent effective in all phases of COVID-19 has been identified.', '[TITLE]: Clinical presentations and outcome of severe acute respiratory syndrome in children [AUTHORS]: Hon, KLE; Leung, CW; Cheng, WTF; Chan, PKS; Chu, WCW; Kwan, YW; Li, AM; Fong, NC; Ng, PC; Chiu, MC; Li, CK; Tam, JS; Fok, TF [JOURNAL]: Lancet [ABSTRACT]: Hong Kong has been severely affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Contact in households and healthcare settings is thought to be important for transmission, putting children at particular risk. Most data so far, however, have been for adults. We prospectively followed up the first ten children with SARS managed during the early phase of the epidemic in Hong Kong. All the children had been in close contact with infected adults. Persistent fever, cough, progressive radiographic changes of chest and lymphopenia were noted in all patients. The children were treated with high-dose ribavirin, oral prednisolone, or intravenous methylprednisolone, with no short-term adverse effects. Four teenagers required oxygen therapy and two needed assisted ventilation. None of the younger children required oxygen supplementation. Compared with adults and teenagers, SARS seems to have a less aggressive clinical course in younger children.', '[TITLE]: Cohort Study of the Impact of High-Dose Opioid Analgesics on Overdose Mortality. [AUTHORS]: Dasgupta, Nabarun; Funk, Michele Jonsson; Proescholdbell, Scott; Hirsch, Annie; Ribisl, Kurt M; Marshall, Steve [JOURNAL]: Pain medicine [ABSTRACT]: OBJECTIVE Previous studies examining opioid dose and overdose risk provide limited granularity by milligram strength and instead rely on thresholds. We quantify dose-dependent overdose mortality over a large spectrum of clinically common doses. We also examine the contributions of benzodiazepines and extended release opioid formulations to mortality. DESIGN Prospective observational cohort with one year follow-up. SETTING One year in one state (NC) using a controlled substances prescription monitoring program, with name-linked mortality data. SUBJECTS Residential population of North Carolina (n = 9,560,234), with 2,182,374 opioid analgesic patients. METHODS Exposure was dispensed prescriptions of solid oral and transdermal opioid analgesics; person-years calculated using intent-to-treat principles. Outcome was overdose deaths involving opioid analgesics in a primary or additive role. Poisson models were created, implemented using generalized estimating equations. RESULTS Opioid analgesics were dispensed to 22.8% of residents. Among licensed clinicians, 89.6% prescribed opioid analgesics, and 40.0% prescribed ER formulations. There were 629 overdose deaths, half of which had an opioid analgesic prescription active on the day of death. Of 2,182,374 patients prescribed opioids, 478 overdose deaths were reported (0.022% per year). Mortality rates increased gradually across the range of average daily milligrams of morphine equivalents. 80.0% of opioid analgesic patients also received benzodiazepines. Rates of overdose death among those co-dispensed benzodiazepines and opioid analgesics were ten times higher (7.0 per 10,000 person-years, 95 percent CI: 6.3, 7.8) than opioid analgesics alone (0.7 per 10,000 person years, 95 percent CI: 0.6, 0.9). CONCLUSIONS Dose-dependent opioid overdose risk among patients increased gradually and did not show evidence of a distinct risk threshold. There is urgent need for guidance about combined classes of medicines to facilitate a better balance between pain relief and overdose risk.', '[TITLE]: Nebulizer systems: a new frontier for therapeutics and targeted delivery [AUTHORS]: Khairnar, Sakshi V; Jain, Divya D; Tambe, Srushti M; Chavan, Yashashri R; Amin, Purnima D [JOURNAL]: Ther Deliv [ABSTRACT]: Drug delivery via the pulmonary route is a cornerstone in the pharmaceutical sector as an alternative to oral and parenteral administration. Nebulizer inhalation treatment offers multiple drug administration, easily employed with tidal breathing, suitable for children and elderly, can be adapted for severe patients and visible spray ensures patient satisfaction. This review discusses the operational and mechanical characteristics of nebulizer delivery devices in terms of aerosol production processes, their usage, benefits and drawbacks that are currently shaping the contemporary landscape of inhaled drug delivery. With the advent of particle engineering, novel inhaled nanosystems can be successfully developed to increase lung deposition and decrease pulmonary clearance.

The expression data analysis of the Renin Angiotensin System indicates mild nasal, oral or throat infections are likely and that the gastrointestinal tissues are a common primary target of SARS-CoV-2. Extreme symptoms in the lower respiratory system likely result from a secondary-infection possibly by a comorbidity-driven upregulation of ACE2 in the lung. The remarkable differences in expression of other RAS elements, the elimination of macrophages and the activation of cytokines in COVID-19 bronchoalveolar samples suggest that a functional immune deficiency is a critical outcome of COVID-19. We posit that using a non-respiratory system as a major pathway of infection is likely determining the unprecedented global spread of this coronavirus.

[AUTHORS]: Kang, Seong Hee; Kim, Moon Young; Cho, Mee Yon; Baik, Soon Koo [JOURNAL]: J Korean Med Sci [ABSTRACT]: Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic, autoimmune disease of the liver that occurs when the body’s immune system attacks liver cells, causing the liver to be inflamed. AIH is one of the manifestations of a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), as well as an adverse event occurring after vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Few cases of AIH have been described after vaccination with two messenger RNA (mRNA)-based vaccines—BTN162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna)—against SARS-CoV-2. Herein, we report a case of AIH occurring after Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. A 27-year-old female presented with jaundice and hepatomegaly, appearing 14 days after receiving the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Her laboratory results showed abnormal liver function with high total immunoglobulin G level. She was diagnosed with AIH with histologic finding and successfully treated with oral prednisolone. We report an AIH case after COVID-19 vaccination in Korea.', '[TITLE]: Protective Effects of Intestinal Gallic Acid in Neonatal Dairy Calves Against Extended-Spectrum β-lactamase Producing Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli Infection: Modulating Intestinal Homeostasis and Colitis [AUTHORS]: He, Zhiyuan; Ma, Yulin; Chen, Xu; Liu, Shuai; Xiao, Jianxin; Wang, Yajing; Wang, Wei; Yang, Hongjian; Li, Shengli; Cao, Zhijun [JOURNAL]: Front Nutr [ABSTRACT]: Calf diarrhea induced by enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) spreads fast among young ruminants, causing continuous hazard to dairy industry. Antimicrobial drug abuse aggravates the incidence rate of multi-drug resistant (MDR) extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing E. coli (ESBL-EC). However, knowledge of detection and significance of disease-related biomarkers in neonatal female calves are still limited. Gallic acid (GA), a natural secondary metabolite mostly derived from plants, has attracted increasing attention for its excellent anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties. However, it is vague how GA engenders amelioration effects on clinical symptoms and colitis induced by ESBL-EAEC infection in neonatal animals. Here, differentiated gut microbiome and fecal metabolome discerned from neonatal calves were analyzed to ascertain biomarkers in their early lives. Commensal Collinsella and Coriobacterium acted as key microbial markers mediating colonization resistance. In addition, there exists a strongly positive relation between GA, short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) or other prebiotics, and those commensals using random forest machine learning algorithm and Spearman correlation analyses. The protective effect of GA pretreatment on bacterial growth, cell adherence, and ESBL-EAEC-lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated Caco-2 cells were first assessed, and results revealed direct antibacterial effects and diminished colonic cell inflammation. Then, oral GA mediated colitis attenuation and recovery of colonic short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) productions on neonatal mice peritonitis sepsis or oral infection model. To corroborate this phenomenon, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) method was adopted to remedy the bacterial infection. Of note, FMT from GA-treated neonatal mice achieved profound remission of clinical symptoms and colitis over the other groups as demonstrated by antibacterial capability and prominent anti-inflammatory abilities, revealing improved hindgut microbiota structure with enriched Clostridia_UCG-014, Lachnospiraceae, Oscillospiraceae, and Enterococcaceae, and upregulation of SCFA productions. Collectively, our findings provided the direct evidence of hindgut microbiota and intestinal metabolites, discriminating the health status of neonatal calves post ESBL-EAEC infection. The data provided novel insights into GA-mediated remission of colitis via amelioration of hindgut commensal structure and upregulation of SCFA productions. In addition, its eminent role as potential antibiotic alternative or synergist for future clinic ESBL-EAEC control in livestock.', '[TITLE]: Oral clarithromycin in COVID-19 of moderate severity: the ACHIEVE open-label trial using concurrent matched comparators [AUTHORS]: Tsiakos, K.; Tsakiris, A.; Tsibris, G.; Voutsinas, P.; Panagopoulos, P.; Kosmidou, M.; Petrakis, V.; Gravvani, A.; Gkavogianni, T.; Klouras, E.; Katrini, K.; Koufargyris, P.; Rapti, I.; Karageorgos, A.; Vrentzos, E.; Damoulari, C.; Zarkada, V.; Sidiropoulou, C.; Artemi, S.; Papapostolou, A.; Michelakis, E.; Georgiopoulou, M.; Myrodia, D.-M.; Tsiamalos, P.; Syrigos, K.; Chrysos, G.; Nitsotolis, T.; Milionis, H.; Poulakou, G.; Giamarellos-Bourboulis, E. [JOURNAL]:  [ABSTRACT]: Background: Clarithromycin clinical efficacy has not been described in COVID-19. Research question: Is oral clarithromycin beneficial for treating patients diagnosed with COVID-19? Study and methods: An open-label non-randomized trial in 90 patients with COVID-19 of moderate severity was conducted at four study sites in Greece between May and October 2020. Ninety participants with respiratory tract infections received clarithromycin 500 mg every 12 hours for 7 days; another 90 standard-of-care (SOC) propensity score-matched concurrent controls received azithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine. The composite primary endpoint was defined for patients with upper respiratory tract infection as: (a) no need for hospital re-admission or (b) lack of progression into lower respiratory tract infection and, for patients with lower respiratory tract infection, as at least 50% decrease of the score of respiratory symptoms at the end-of-treatment (EOT) without progression into severe respiratory failure (SRF). The incidence SRF at the test-of-cure (TOC) on day 14 was a secondary endpoint. For clarithromycin-treated patients, viral load of SARS-CoV-2, biomarkers, the function of mononuclear cells, and safety were assessed; biomarkers were also measured in SOC comparators. Results: The primary endpoint was attained in 86.7% of patients treated with clarithromycin (95% CIs 78.1-92.2%) and 73.3% of concurrent SOC comparators (95%CIs; 63.4-81.4%). The odds ratio for the primary endpoint with clarithromycin treatment in univariate analysis was 2.36 (95%CIs 1.09-5.08; P: 0.039). Results were confirmed after multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis (odds ratio 3.30; 95% CI 1.10-9.87; P: 0.033). At the TOC visit, the incidence of SRF was 12.2% (n = 11 ; 95%CIs 6.9-20.6%) among patients treated with clarithromycin (odds ratio for SRF 0.38; 95%CIs 0.17-0.84) versus 26.7% (n= 24; 95%CIs 18.6-36.6%) among concurrent SOC comparators (P: 0.023). Clarithromycin use was associated with decreases in circulating levels of C-reactive protein, of tumour necrosis factor-alpha and of interleukin (IL)-6; by an increase of the ratio of Th1 to Th2 mononuclear responses; and by suppression of SARS-CoV-2 relative viral load. No safety concerns were reported. Patients starting clarithromycin with the first five days from symptoms onset achieved better responses. Interpretation: Clarithromycin treatment is associated with early clinical improvement in patients with moderate COVID-19. Modulation of the Th1/Th2 responses is proposed as the mechanism of action.']}]\n"
